REASONS: 1.4 (B)(D). \\n \\n1. (C) Summary. Ambassador Sobel, who arrived in Brazil in \\nAugust, presented his credentials to President Lula da Silva \\non 7 November, in a ceremony long delayed by Brazil\\'s \\nelection campaign season.  The 30-minute meeting with Lula \\nwas positive and substantive, with warm atmospherics.  Prior \\nto the credential ceremony, Lula,s chief of staff, Gilberto \\nCarvalho, greeted the Ambassador personally, then later \\narranged for Mrs. Sobel to enter the meeting room for photos \\nwith Lula.  Through these gestures and Lula,s remarks in the \\nmeeting, we received a continuation of the message we have \\nbeen getting from the GOB since Lula,s re-election -- the \\nGOB wants to refocus on and intensify relations with us. Key \\npoints of the meeting follow in para 2.  End summary. \\n \\n2. (C) Ambassador Sobel, along with ambassadors from Namibia, \\nVietnam and Mexico, presented credentials on 7 November at \\nPlanalto Palace. (Note: Brazil\\'s foreign ministry (MRE) \\norganizes presentation of ambassadorial credentials into \\ngroups of four, based on order of arrival in country. End \\nnote.)  All of the 7 November group had been waiting several \\nmonths for the credentials ceremony, owing to repeated delays \\ncaused by Brazil\\'s presidential election season, which \\nconcluded with Lula\\'s re-election victory on 29 October. Each \\nambassador met separately with Lula, who determined the \\nlength of the conversation.  Lula conversed with Ambassador \\nfor approximately 30 minutes, and was accompanied by Foreign \\nMinister Celso Amorim and Presidential foreign policy advisor \\nMarco Aurelio Garcia.  Ambassador was accompanied in the \\nmeeting by A/DCM and Management Counselor, and later joined \\nby Mrs. Sobel for photos and to observe conclusion of the \\nceremony with Ambassador\\'s review of the palace guard.  Key \\npoints of the meeting with Lula follow below: \\n \\n--Bio-fuels:  Lula led with this and stayed with the subject \\nthroughout the first part of the conversation with \\nAmbassador.  Lula noted he had discussed bio-fuels \\nextensively with President Bush.  Lula stressed Brazil,s \\ndesire for partnerships with the USG and American firms in \\nthis, calling it a transformational technology that could \\ndramatically improve lives throughout the world. Lula noted \\nBrazil is bringing on line a total of 93 distilleries for \\nbio-fuel processing in the next years.  Ambassador Sobel \\nconfirmed President Bush\\'s keen attention to the issue, and \\npresented Lula with a photo, autographed by President Bush, \\nfrom the G-8 St. Petersburg ministerial, where Lula presented \\ninformation on Brazil\\'s bio-fuels program to the President. \\nAmbassador further explained that the USG continues to \\norganize its interagency to address bio-fuels in a \\ncomprehensive policy format, and that Under Secretary Josette \\nSheeran recently had been given the USG lead on bio-fuels and \\nis anxious to visit Brazil this year. \\n \\n--Visit to U.S.:  Lula noted that he spoken recently with \\nPresident Bush, who asked him to visit the U.S.  Lula \\nexpressed a desire to visit soon, though he quipped that he \\nworried about the cold in Washington.  Ambassador noted that \\nhe also had been in touch with the White House on the visit, \\nand made himself available to Lula and his chief of staff to \\ndiscuss windows of opportunity and venues. \\n \\n--Strategic relationship:  Lula noted that the GOB wants to \\nsend a new ambassador to Washington asap. (Note: Current MRE \\nUnder Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador Antonio de \\nAguiar Patriota has been presented for agrement vice \\nAmbassador Roberto Abdenur).  Lula seemed anxious to convey \\nthis as a positive signal.  Lula then made a strong and \\ndirect declaration: \"We intend to take all steps necessary to \\nmake clear, beyond any doubt, that the U.S. and Brazil have a \\nstrategic relationship.\"  Ambassador welcomed this, and \\nreplied that the USG is not concerned with Brazil\\'s \\n\"prioritization\" of its relations with countries, but rather \\nis focused on \"what we can do together.\"  In response, Lula \\nand Amorim simultaneously weighed in to dismiss media \\nspeculation that GOB foreign policy priorities remain focused \\non south-south relations.  Lula also noted that he wanted to \\nre-invigorate the working groups established in various areas \\nduring his official visit to Washington at the beginning of \\n \\nBRASILIA 00002352  002 OF 002 \\n \\n \\nhis first term. \\n \\n3. (C) Comment:  The reception at Planalto and the \\nconversation with Lula could not have been more positive.  In \\nthe days following Lula\\'s re-election, the signals continue \\nto be clear and persistent that the GOB wants to move more \\nour way in the second term.  But we will remain in wait and \\nsee mode for now, staying attentive to other developments \\nthat would indicate whether this charm offensive translates \\ninto a meaningful shift in foreign policy for Brazil. \\n \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

(C) Summary: PMDB Congressman and elder statesman Antonio \\nDelfim Netto told CG that while President Lula remains \\npersonally popular, he needs to start courting the PMDB and \\nthe smaller &left light8 parties if he hopes to get \\nre-elected in next October,s elections.  Netto said the \\nPSDB/PFL electoral alliance poses a formidable front that \\ncould defeat Lula in a likely second round, particularly if \\nthe PSDB chooses Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin as its \\ncandidate.  In contrast to the increasingly united PSDB/PFL \\nalliance, Netto noted that Lula has not taken any steps to \\nforge an alliance with the large, though divided, PMDB. (He \\ndownplayed the possibility of the PMDB selecting a viable \\npresidential candidate from its own ranks.)  Netto also \\ncriticized the PT,s political immaturity, pointing to the \\nrecent PT National Directorate,s public manifesto \\nchallenging Lula,s economic policy.  Netto said that while \\nLula was conservative by nature, he was unlikely to change \\nhis top foreign policy advisers, whom he characterized as \\ninstinctively anti-American.  He also ruled out any dramatic \\nforeign policy changes in a second-term Lula government, \\naverring that the Foreign Ministry would continue to reflect \\nthe PT,s antipathy towards an FTAA and a more strategic \\nrelationship with the United States.  End Summary. \\n \\n2. (C) CG and Poloff met December 13 with Federal Deputy \\nAntonio Delfim Netto to discuss Brazil,s political and \\neconomic situation and the upcoming elections.  Netto, who \\nserved as Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning in the \\n1970s and  80s, enjoys a reputation as balanced and credible \\nelder statesman. While his party forms part of the governing \\ncoalition, Netto was surprisingly candid and critical of the \\nruling PT and some key aspects of Lula,s policies. \\n \\n3.  (C) Netto, who in recent months joined the Brazilian \\nDemocratic Movement Party (PMDB) after years as a member of \\nthe Progressivist Party (PP), characterized the PMDB as \\n&two-headed.8  There is a significant pro-government \\nfaction, as well as an anti-government faction which is \\nhighly critical of the Lula government but which also depends \\non the government for favors (The independent-minded Netto \\ndoes not fit neatly into either camp).  In the face of these \\ninternal divisions, the PMDB must decide whether to select \\nits own presidential candidate or, if Lula appears a likely \\nwinner, cut a deal to support Lula. \\n \\n4. (C) Netto opined that after all the scandals it has \\nsuffered, Lula,s Workers, Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores \\n) PT) will do well to elect 40 deputies in the October 2006 \\nelection, he opined (it currently has 90).  He said support \\nfrom the PMDB would be critical to Lula,s reelection bid \\nbecause the PMDB has many strong gubernatorial candidates who \\ncould provide crucial coattails.  Netto faulted Lula for not \\ntaking any early steps to forge a strong PT-PMDB alliance. As \\na result, some PMDB leaders are pressing for the party to run \\nits own presidential candidate. \\n \\n5. (C) Netto dismissed the likelihood of the PMDB fielding a \\nviable presidential candidate, noting that Supreme Federal \\nTribunal (STF)President Nelson Jobim is unlikely to garner \\nsufficient party support.  Similarly, Rio Grande do Sul \\nGovernor Germano Rigotto is &extraordinary8 but lacks the \\nnational exposure needed to make a successful run.  Netto \\ncharacterized former Rio de Janeiro Governor Anthony \\nGarotinho as a dangerous populist, whose main support comes \\nfrom evangelical Christians. \\n \\n6. (C) Netto noted that the PSDB and PFL appear increasingly \\nunited and thus pose a credible challenge for Lula.  Sao \\nPaulo Mayor Jose Serra (PSDB) is a tough and seasoned \\ncandidate who has national recognition.  Netto, however, \\nconsiders Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin (also \\nPSDB) an even greater threat to Lula,s reelection bid. \\nAlckmin is a respected and able administrator who would be a \\nvery strong candidate, although Netto acknowledged that Serra \\nwould be tough to beat for the PSDB nomination. \\n \\n7. (C) Netto offered candid opinions on Lula and the PT.  The \\nparty,s National Directorate,s recent manifesto criticizing \\nthe government,s economic policy exposed the party,s \\npolitical immaturity.  The Directorate has always been more \\nof an academic center or discussion group, creating many \\ninternal fissures and tensions.  Lula won the 2002 election \\nbased on his personal popularity and his ability to attract \\nstrong support from outside the PT.  He,s not a leftist at \\nheart, but rather a culturally conservative Catholic labor \\nleader with good political instincts.  In contrast to Lula,s \\npolitical pragmatism, others in the PT and government are \\n&revolutionaries who want to change the world.8 \\n \\n8. (C) According to Netto, Lula is dealing with a difficult \\neconomic situation that he inherited from former President \\nFernando Henrique Cardoso:  a high tax burden, a fiscal \\ndeficit, and a high debt-to-GDP ratio.  The Central Bank has \\nexacerbated the situation by keeping interest rates too high, \\ninhibiting growth.  These problems are hard to correct in the \\nshort term, particularly with the continuing investigations \\nsurrounding the political scandals, which are a complicating \\nLula,s situation. Despite losing some support inside and \\noutside of his party, Lula will benefit from the &Bolsa \\nFamilia8 welfare program, which should garner crucial blocs \\nof votes in the impoverished north and northeastern parts of \\nBrazil.  Also, Lula is a charismatic speaker who is able to \\ncapture the popular vote without being a populist. \\n \\n9. (C) Commenting on the Lula government,s foreign policy, \\nNetto sharply criticized the Foreign Ministry (Itamaraty) for \\nideologically driven policies that do not reflect the \\ncountry,s national interests.  He attributed these \\nmisdirected policies to leftist, anti-American ideologues in \\nsenior positions, such as MFA Secretary General Samuel \\nPinheiro Guimaraes and presidential adviser Marco Aurelio \\nGarcia.  Netto said FTAA is absolutely essential to \\nstrengthening economic ties, stimulating investment and \\nbringing in partnerships and joint ventures, but believes \\nthere will not be any progress on FTAA as long as Guimarees \\nand Garcia are directing Lula,s foreign policies.  According \\nto Netto, Garcia and Guimaraes wield tremendous influence \\nover Lula even though he doesn,t share their political \\noutlook or temperament.  Netto averred that both will likely \\ncontinue in their positions should Lula win a second term, \\nadding that Brazil,s foreign policy is unlikely to change \\ncourse with respect to the United States.  (He described the \\nbilateral relationship as &friendly but superficial.8) \\nDespite these obstacles at the governmental level, Netto said \\nmuch can be done in terms of outreach to strengthen \\nunderstanding between the U.S. and Brazil, which share many \\ncommon interests. \\n \\n10.   (C) Comment: Netto is a prominent economist by training \\nwho has been in public life for over 40 years.  He held a \\nnumber of senior governmental positions under the military \\ndictatorship and has been a Federal Deputy since 1987.  He is \\na well-informed, articulate and candid observer whose views \\nare not infused with strong political partisanship.  However, \\nhe only recently joined the PMDB and does not wield strong \\ninfluence in the party.  Thus, his (implied) preference for \\nanalliance between the PMDB and Lula may not reflect party \\nleadership thinking.  Other PMDB representatives we have \\nspoken to recently ) for example, Sao Paulo state party \\nchairman Orestes Quercia ) strongly favor having the PMDB \\nrun its own presidential candidate, though preferably not \\nGarotinho.  Given the deep divisions in the PMDB at the \\nnational level, it would be difficult for the party to field \\na viable presidential candidate. For this reason, Netto \\nbelieves it would be more advantageous politically for the \\nPMDB to strike a strategic deal with Lula and the PT, even if \\nthis means accepting some policies that do not sit well with \\nthe PMDB rank and file.   End comment. \\n \\n11.  (U) This message was cleared/coordinated with Embassy \\nBrasilia. \\nMCMULLEN \\n',\n",

Sobel, Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) \\n \\n1. (C) In a meeting with Ambassador Sobel March 28, British \\nAmbassador to Brazil Alan Charlton provided a readout of the \\nMarch 26 meeting between Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula \\nda Silva and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  Charlton \\nsaid that the economic crisis was the principal topic of \\nconversation, with Brown pushing for Brazil to participate in \\nthe efforts to increase financing, specifically through the \\nIMF New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB).  Lula was \\nnon-committal.  Lula told Brown that whatever new \\norganization (e.g., G-20, G-8 plus 5) emerges from current \\ndiscussions, Brazil will participate. \\n \\n2. (C) Brown and Lula also discussed working together to help \\nthe global community understand that the Doha trade round can \\nbe part of the solution to the current crisis.  Lula asked \\nabout Europe\\'s support for restarting Doha.  Brown said that \\nFrance and Germany could be convinced, but only if the United \\nStates shows interest in restarting talks within the next six \\nmonths. \\n \\n3. (C) According to Charlton, other topics raised were: \\n \\n--Climate Change: Brown also pushed for a \"more realistic\" \\napproach by Brazil to climate change, i.e., one that involves \\ntaking on commitments.  According to Charlton, when Foreign \\nMinister Celso Amorim tried to intervene regarding \\ndifferentiated responsibilities, Lula cut him off. \\n \\n-- WTO Appellate Body: Lula brought up with Brown Brazil\\'s \\ncandidate for the WTO court, Supreme Court Justice Ellen \\nGracie Northfleet, saying he intended to raise her nomination \\nwith President Obama as well. \\n \\n-- Nuclear Non-Proliferation: Brown raised concerns regarding \\nthe doctoral thesis of a Brazilian Army nuclear physicist, \\nDalton Barroso, that reportedly addresses how to develop a \\nnuclear weapons program.  (Note: The Brazilian MOD has \\nrefused to allow Barroso to be interviewed by the IAEA about \\nhis ideas. End note.) \\n \\n-- UNSC: Lula aggressively pushed Brazil\\'s interest in a \\npermanent UN Security Council seat.  Brown confirmed that \\nboth France and Britain support Brazil. \\n \\n-- Food Security: Brown and Lula discussed food security in \\nAfrica.  According to Charlton, Lula was very engaged, and \\nthere was agreement to seek ways to work together via the \\nBritish Development Ministry and Brazil\\'s Cooperation Agency \\n(ABC). \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

(SBU) Summary.  In a rare meeting granted by President Lula to a \\nUS congressional delegation, President Lula told CoDel Hoyer April 8 \\nthat he has high expectations of the Obama administration, sees a \\nnew era in U.S. relations with Latin America, and hopes for a \\npositive gesture on Cuba at the Summit of the Americas.  Lula \\nstressed the importance of direct leader involvement in the Doha \\nRound to produce a successful outcome, urged the United States to \\nbegin a new relationship with Venezuela, and said he would go to \\nIran soon because Brazil sees value in dialogue with Iran and has \\npolitical and economic interests there.  He urged the creation of a \\nregular bilateral U.S.-Brazil congressional exchange, especially on \\nenergy.  He described a financial aid program for low-income college \\nstudents.  Septels will report on other Codel meetings.  End \\nsummary \\n \\nHoyer:  Brazil is important \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n2. (SBU) Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman Lucille \\nRoybal-Allard, Congressman Elijah Cummings, Congressman Gregory \\nMeeks, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Congressman Adrian \\nSmith, Congressman Gerry Connolly, Congressman Aaron Schock, \\nstaffers Mariah Sixkiller and Brian Diffell, Charge Lisa Kubiske, \\nand Poloff (notetaker) met on April 8 with President Lula, who was \\naccompanied by Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia, Deputy \\nForeign Policy Advisor Marcel Biato, and Foreign Policy Unit aide \\nElio Cardoso. \\n \\n3. (SBU) Congressman Hoyer told President Lula that the delegation \\nhad come to Brazil because of Brazil\\'s extraordinary importance. \\nHoyer noted Lula\\'s achievements as president, Brazil\\'s hemispheric \\nand global role, and its critical role in the G-20.   President \\nObama recognizes Brazil\\'s importance: Lula was the first Latin \\nAmerican leader he met with, which was an important signal, and \\nBrazil and the United States must be partners, Hoyer said. \\nPresidents Obama and Lula, together with their colleagues, have an \\nopportunity to confront major problems such as the economy, the \\nenvironment, and hunger, Hoyer told the president, and thanked him \\nfor his role in the region. \\n \\nLula: \"New Era\" in U.S.-Latin American Relations \\n- - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n4.  (SBU) A wide-ranging conversation that was to have lasted 30 \\nminutes but stretched to 90 followed Hoyer\\'s opening remarks, \\npeppered with Lula\\'s characteristic personal anecdotes and jokes. \\nLula opened by declaring, \"I have a conviction - it is pure \\nintuition - that Obama may set out a new era in U.S.-Latin American \\nrelations and U.S.-African relations.\"  He pointed to a time of \\nopportunity for President Obama, saying the situation in the region \\nis now \"totally changed\" from the past, when \"mistaken policies in \\nLatin America,\" armed struggles and other things that took place \\nduring the Cold War caused anti-Americanism in the region. \\n \\nLatin America Has Changed \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n5.  (SBU) Latin America has undergone a profound change, he \\nexplained, and credited the Sao Paulo Forum, founded in 1990 by the \\nWorkers\\' Party, as the starting point that brought regional leftist \\ngroups together and set them on a path of attaining power through \\npeaceful political activity.  This mainstreaming has today borne \\nfruit in the election of leftist leaders throughout the region, Lula \\nsaid, including himself, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and \\nmany others, and, most recently, Mauricio Funes of El Salvador.  He \\nsaid all those who formerly professed mass struggle are organizing \\npolitical parties today, concluding, \"We proved that the easiest way \\nto power was through elections.\" \\n \\n6.  (SBU) Lula said the inspiration for convening the Forum came \\nafter he had turned around his flagging presidential campaign in \\n1989 and made it to the second round of the election.  \"Never in \\nLatin America had a lathe operator gotten so far,\" he told the \\nvisiting congressmen, \"and because we had come out stronger, I \\ndecided to call in all the leftist parties from Latin America.\"  He \\nnoted that almost all of them have by now come into power.  Asked \\nwhether he was responsible for all this, Lula pointed at his foreign \\npolicy adviser, Marco Aurelio Garcia, and replied half-jokingly, \\n\"He, more than I.\" \\n \\nBRASILIA 00000445  002 OF 004 \\n \\n \\n \\n7.  (SBU) Still, Lula said, the \"prejudices\" of the Cold War period \\npersist, but personal relationships can solve problems that email \\nand faxes cannot. Only personal chemistry can solve problems.  He \\nsaid President Obama could do more than he was able to in six years, \\nand he is already getting started. \\n \\nWe are all interdependent \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n8.  (SBU) Congressman Hoyer observed that President Obama can \\nbenefit from Lula\\'s experience and that one country alone can no \\nlonger stabilize the world.  Lula agreed and stated, \"Today we all \\ndepend a little on China,\" half-jokingly recalling the amount of \\n\"Made in China\" goods he has seen in U.S. stores.  \"Trade has made \\nus all more interdependent,\" he concluded. \\n \\nRelationship with Bush could not have been better \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n9.  (SBU) Lula said his relationship with President George W. Bush \\nwas very respectful and could not have been better.  He recalled \\ntheir first meeting:  Bush was focused on Iraq, war, and \\noverthrowing Saddam Hussein.  Lula replied, telling Bush his own war \\nwas not with Iraq, but with poverty and hunger.  At the time, Lula \\nrecalled, he was sure Iraq had no chemical weapons, and a senior \\nBrazilian member of the weapons inspections team had been pulled out \\nat U.S. insistence because he also believed there were no chemical \\nweapons.  On the other hand, Lula observed, Saddam Hussein was a \\n\"madman who didn\\'t have the courage to admit that he didn\\'t have the \\nweapons.\" \\n \\nObama will be extraordinary \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n10.  (SBU) Returning to Obama, Lula said he believes U.S. foreign \\npolicy is becoming more proactive yet without being a \"mere \\ninterference in other countries\\' affairs.\"  Obama will be \\nextraordinary, in part for the things we share.  He can make a big \\ndifference, especially in relations with smaller countries.  Africa, \\nfor example, needs to develop or its rapidly increasing populations \\nwill emigrate to developed countries such as the United States. \\nLula said he believes leaders of developed countries need to visit \\nAfrica to understand its realities, noting that he has visited 23 \\nAfrican countries. \\n \\nLula to Obama: Use Political Capital to do the Necessary \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n11. (SBU) Politics is a perverse business, Lula explained, and one\\'s \\nfortunes rise and fall quickly, so Obama must use his political \\ncapital now to do what must be done.  Leaders, in his view, must \\nbecome personally involved in the Doha Round, the G-8, the G-14, the \\nG-20, and the Summit of the Americas in order to break free from the \\nbureaucratic machinery of advisers and ministries and bring true \\nadvances.  He said he had warned Obama of the danger of \"being \\nswallowed by the machine,\" which he likened to Chaplin\\'s \"Modern \\nTimes.\" \\n \\nDoha Round \\n- - - - - - \\n \\n12. (SBU) In reply to Congressman Meeks\\'s question about the Doha \\nRound, Lula said it was necessary to \"take it back from technicians\" \\nand let the politicians take over to get beyond technical details \\nand reach a decision at the political level.  He said he agreed with \\nPresident Sarkozy\\'s suggestion of a leaders\\' discussion at the G-8 \\nin Rome next June, was convinced that the United States did not have \\nto give up anything to reach success and it would be good for the \\npoorest countries. \\n \\nThe Summit of the Americas...and Cuba, Venezuela \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n13.  (SBU) Asked about the upcoming Summit of the Americas, Lula \\nnoted that the declaration has already been completed.  Lula \\ncharacterized the Summit as a leftover from the failed FTAA process \\nand said both the Summit of the Americas and the Ibero-American \\nSummit no longer have much meaning because they are so scripted. \\n \\nBRASILIA 00000445  003 OF 004 \\n \\n \\nThe proof is that the economic crisis will not even be mentioned in \\nPort of Spain. \\n \\n14.  (SBU) Cuba will be raised at the Summit of the Americas, but no \\none wants Obama to be embarrassed over Cuba, least of all the \\nCubans, Lula noted, because that would strengthen U.S. hardliners. \\nLula expects a peaceful summit without any verbal attacks on the \\nPresident over Cuba.  There is hope in Latin America for a change in \\nU.S. policy on Cuba; expectations are so high that if Obama is \\nsilent on Cuba at the SOA it will cause frustration.  Other leaders \\nsuch as Calderon of Mexico, Preval of Haiti and Uribe of Colombia \\nwill make statements on Cuba.  \"Let\\'s break the taboo...We need to \\nsolve the problem with Cuba.  Let\\'s establish a new U.S.-Cuban \\nrelationship,\" he proposed.  Obama should make a positive gesture \\ntowards Cuba such as allowing all American citizens to visit Cuba. \\n(Note: Coincidentally, the CoDel\\'s meeting came only hours after an \\nunannounced meeting between Lula and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno \\nRodriguez.  End note.) \\n \\n15.  (SBU) Asked whether Hugo Chavez would not attack Obama at the \\nSummit, Lula said he thinks not.  He added that criticism and \\nprovocation of Chavez are not constructive and only strengthen \\nChavez.  In Lula\\'s view, U.S.-Venezuelan relations are like \"a fight \\nbetween a husband and wife.\"  \"The fight may have been pleasant for \\na while, but no longer is.\"  Obama can start a new relationship with \\nVenezuela, and the U.S. and Venezuela should exchange ambassadors, \\nLula stated. \\n \\nIran \\n- - - \\n \\n16. (SBU) Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz urged Lula to \"go \\nslow\" on Iran.  Lula replied that he regrets not having gone to Iran \\nearlier because President Ahmadinejad needs to hear points of view \\nother than those of Daniel Ortega and Hugo Chavez.  He is going to \\nIran (though probably not until after the elections there), he said, \\nbecause Brazil has political and economic interests there and Iran \\nis important to Brazil and important in the region.  Lula said \\nBrazil has always had a good trade relationship with Iran, although \\ngreatly in Brazil\\'s favor, and he would discuss nuclear energy with \\nIran.  (Note: Following the March visit of Iran\\'s foreign minister \\nto Brasilia, senior GOB officials have confirmed that a visit by \\nIranian President Ahmadinejad to Brazil is in the works, perhaps as \\nearly as May.  Brazilian engagement with Iran should be viewed in \\nthe context of Brazil\\'s south-south diplomatic outreach, since in \\nLula\\'s view there is value for Brazil in dialogue with Iran that \\ngoes beyond commercial interests.  Charge heard a similar view on \\nApril 8 from Ambassador Roberto Jaguaribe, Under Secretary for \\nPolitical Affairs at the Ministry for External Relations, who \\nemphasized the importance of direct dialogue with Iran, noting that \\n\"peripheral\" countries should talk to and exchange information with \\neach other directly and not through the United States or Europe \\n(septel). End note.) \\n \\nCongressional Exchanges \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n17.  (SBU) President Lula noted the absence of a strong relationship \\nbetween our congresses and encouraged the U.S. members of congress \\nto work toward the creation of a regular, institutionalized, \\nbilateral congressional exchange.  He suggested energy as an \\nappropriate focus.  Congressman Hoyer said he would follow up. \\n \\n18.  (U) Finally, Lula told the delegation about Pro-Uni (University \\nfor All Program), an educational initiative to help underprivileged \\nstudents.  Lula explained that under Pro-Uni the GOB grants a tax \\nexemption to private universities, which in turn contribute the \\nvalue of the exemption to a scholarship fund for poor and black \\nstudents in private universities.  Students must have attended a \\npublic school in order to receive benefits.  Lula said 56,000 \\nstudents from poor communities, 40% of them black, have graduated \\nfrom colleges because of Pro-Uni, today 45% of students in private \\nuniversities are black, and Pro-Uni represents a revolution for \\nBrazil.  Congressman Hoyer replied that private universities in the \\nUnited States are already tax exempt and the government assists low \\nincome students through the Pell Grant program, which has been \\nexpanded in recent years.  (Background note: Public universities in \\nBrazil are free and admission is competitive.  Students who graduate \\nfrom public high schools, which are generally inferior to private \\n \\nBRASILIA 00000445  004 OF 004 \\n \\n \\nschools, are less well prepared for the entrance exams than private \\nschool graduates.  As a result, public school graduates, who come \\nfrom the poorest Brazilian families, are the least able to pay \\ntuition, are disproportionately black and mulatto, but generally \\nmust attend private universities -- or no university -- while those \\nwhose families could afford private school attend tuition-free \\npublic universities.  Pro-Uni was designed to address this \\nsituation.  End background note.) \\n \\n19.  (SBU) Embassy Comment: Lula had not received a U.S. \\ncongressional delegation in at least three years, and his decision \\nto receive the Hoyer delegation signals a greater receptiveness and \\nmore positive evaluation of the value of such contacts on the part \\nof the Presidential Palace.  End Embassy comment. \\n \\n20. (U) The Hoyer delegation has cleared this message. \\n \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

Lula stressed the importance of direct leader involvement in the Doha Round to produce a successful outcome, urged the United States to begin a new relationship with Venezuela, and said he would go to Iran soon because Brazil sees value in dialogue with Iran and has political and economic interests there. He urged the creation of a regular bilateral U.S.-Brazil congressional exchange, especially on energy. He described a financial aid program for low-income college students.

(SBU) SUMMARY.  The large PMDB party decided at a December \\n12 convention to defect from the governing coalition of \\nBrazilian President Lula da Silva.  The decision exacerbated \\nthe rift between the party\\'s pro- and anti-government wings, \\nbut as the dust settles it appears that Lula could benefit \\nfrom the crisis.  Lula plans to keep the two PMDB members in \\nhis cabinet and will continue to collaborate with the \\npro-government PMDB members of Congress.  This posture has \\nhelped to solidify the party\\'s pro-government wing, and Lula \\ncan now reasonably count on most of the PMDB votes in both \\nhouses.  The crisis may not play out until February, but with \\nthe administration and savvy PMDB Senator Jose Sarney working \\nagainst the withdrawal from the coalition (and the \\nanti-government wing making tactical blunders), Lula may well \\nturn the crisis in his favor.  END SUMMARY. \\n \\n2. (SBU) The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement \\n(PMDB) is being derided as the \"Party of the Brazilian \\nDisorganized Mix-ups\".  The anti-government wing forced a \\nvote at a December 12 party convention to pull out of Lula\\'s \\ncoalition (reftel).  By this, party leaders hoped to \\nestablish themselves as \"independent\" of Lula\\'s Workers\\' \\nParty (PT) so that they can run against Lula and the PT\\'s \\nother candidates in the 2006 elections.  However, those party \\nleaders are now on the defensive as the pro-government wing \\nhas united in a counter-attack supported by the \\nadministration. \\n \\nPMDB CAUCUS IN CONGRESS SWINGS TOWARD LULA \\n------------------------------------------ \\n3. (SBU) In Congress, leading PMDB Senators Jose Sarney and \\nRenan Calheiros have finally buried the hatchet on their \\ndispute over who will be the next Senate President (it will \\nlikely be Calheiros).  Their reconciliation brought together \\nthe PMDB caucus in the Senate so that 20 of the party\\'s 23 \\nSenators are now counted as pro-government.  Sarney\\'s \\nsupport, in particular, is key.  His political instincts are \\nunrivalled, and he is a devoted government ally who can pull \\ninnumerable strings on Lula\\'s behalf (but on the few \\noccasions that he has been irritated with the administration, \\nhe has caused it to lose key floor votes).  In the lower \\nhouse, the picture is similar.  The party\\'s pro-government \\nfaction in the Chamber showed its teeth December 15 in \\ncollecting 47 votes (of the party\\'s 78 Deputies) to retain \\npro-government Deputy Jose Borba as party whip.  Thus the \\npro-Lula faction owns a solid majority of the party caucus in \\nboth houses. \\n \\nTEMER\\'S FAILED MOVE TO EXPEL DISSIDENTS \\n--------------------------------------- \\n4. (SBU)  As a key coalition member, the PMDB nominated two \\ncabinet ministers and several other senior administration \\nofficials.  In the wake of the party\\'s withdrawal from the \\ncoalition, PMDB president Michel Temer, who leads the party\\'s \\nanti-government bloc, ordered these officials to quit their \\nposts.  They refused, and Temer moved to expel them from the \\nparty.  Those threatened with expulsion are:  Communications \\nMinister Eunicio Oliveira, Social Security Minister Amir \\nLando, Director of the Social Security Agency (INSS) Carlos \\nBezerra, Director of Petrobras\\'s transportation unit \\n(Transpetro) Sergio Machado, and Director of the Postal \\nSystem (Correios) Joao Henrique de Almeida.  But the battle \\nis also being waged in the courts, and Temer\\'s move was \\nshort-circuited by a judge\\'s decision that declared the \\nentire PMDB convention void.  Thus, the party members who \\nhold posts in Lula\\'s administration will defy Temer and keep \\ntheir jobs.  As a tactical matter, Temer\\'s move to expel the \\nfive was a failed show of strength that backfired and may \\ncost him dearly as events unfold. \\n \\nLULA CAPITALIZING ON THE SITUATION \\n---------------------------------- \\n5. (SBU) The day after the December 12 party convention, Lula \\nmet with the PMDB\\'s pro-government leaders and reportedly \\noffered them behind-the-scenes support to replace Temer with \\nSarney as party president in mid-2005.  In the meantime, Lula \\nwill seek to exploit the party\\'s divisions by working \\nexclusively with the pro-government faction, offering support \\nand pork spending to its congressional bloc, and keeping the \\ntwo PMDB cabinet ministers in place.  Lula pointedly said \\nthis week that he plans no cabinet shuffle until January at \\nthe earliest. \\n \\nCOMMENT \\n------- \\n6. (SBU)  Senator Jose Sarney and the pro-government wing of \\nthe PMDB are counter-attacking, and Sarney is a formidable \\ntactician who has already managed to forge a weighty support \\nbloc in Congress.  Party President Michel Temer and the \\nanti-government wing have the support of the large party \\ndelegations from Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and a handful of \\nother key states that have never been comfortable in Lula\\'s \\ncamp.  Both sides will continue to maneuver, but in the \\nshort-term, Lula will to treat the pro-government wing as a \\ncoalition member (and will retain his PMDB cabinet \\nministers).  Congress will go out of session by December 30, \\nso the crisis may not play out until February or March. \\nSenator Jorge Bornhausen (president of the opposition PFL \\nparty) notes with dismay that the crisis has had the effect \\nof clearly defining the  PMDB\\'s internal rift and making its \\npro-government wing more committed to Lula.  Thus, he \\npredicts, the work of the opposition may become more \\ndifficult in the coming year because it will be harder to \\npick off disaffected PMDB members during votes.  On the other \\nhand, Rio Mayor Cesar Maia, also of the PFL, commented in the \\npress that \"the PMDB is a rare case of a party that gets \\nstronger with disunity.  As the sides become defined, the \\ngovernment and opposition wings get stronger through \\nbargaining.  When it is united, the party is weaker.\" \\nDANILOVICH \\n',\n",

(SBU) Federal Deputy Delfim Netto predicted President Lula will \\nwin a \"fairly close\" election in the second round if he can avoid \\ncommitting too many more gaffes.  Lula\\'s Workers Party (PT), \\nhowever, will take a serious hit because of corruption scandals and \\nwill end up with fewer than 50 Federal Deputies.  However, the \\ncentrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), of which Netto \\nis a recent member, will hold a bloc of about 80 seats and will ally \\nwith Lula\\'s administration to get jobs and other favors.  Lula will \\nbe able to patch together enough support from smaller parties to get \\nlegislation passed.  In fact, Netto said, Lula was perhaps the only \\none who could push critical legislation like social security reform \\nand labor reform through the Congress.  Leftist forces would accept \\nsuch reforms if sponsored by Lula, but would oppose and ultimately \\ndefeat them if PSDB candidate Geraldo Alckmin won the presidency and \\ntried to pursue such reforms.  For this reason, Netto himself plans \\nto vote for Lula.  In a second administration, Netto predicted, Lula \\nwill continue his macro-economic orthodoxy but with more \\nflexibility, leaving in place Central Bank President Henrique \\nMeirelles while appointing other officials who will likely push down \\ninterest rates and promote pro-growth policies.  In Sao Paulo state, \\nNetto predicted that former Mayor Jose Serra will win the \\ngovernorship in the first round, though scenarios could yet arise \\nthat might undermine his chances.  END SUMMARY. \\n \\n--------------------------------------------- - \\nLULA EXPECTED TO WIN A \"FAIRLY CLOSE\" ELECTION \\n--------------------------------------------- - \\n \\n2.  (SBU) In a recent meeting with Poloff and Political Assistant, \\nAntonio Delfim Netto (reftel), an elder statesman of Brazil\\'s \\npolitical class, shared his predictions for the electoral campaign. \\nNetto expects that opposition candidate Geraldo Alckmin will narrow \\nthe gap separating him from President Lula and force the election \\ninto a second round.  Lula is probably at his ceiling right now, \\nwhereas Alckmin has plenty of room to grow.  Third-party candidate \\nHeloisa Helena will also rise above her current 10 percent, Netto \\npredicted, because her brand of radical socialism mixed with \\nChristianity appeals to many voters on the fringes.  However, faced \\nwith the prospect of an Alckmin victory, many such voters will opt \\nfor Lula in the second round, and he should win a narrow victory. \\nLula\\'s greatest challenge between now and the election, in Netto\\'s \\nview, will be to avoid saying things that may alienate voters (e.g., \\nrecent gaffe of his was interpreted by many as denigrating the \\nintelligence of the elderly). \\n \\n3.  (SBU) Netto noted that in 2002, Lula had carried his Workers \\nParty (PT) to power, not the other way around.  The 2002 elections \\nrepresented a vote against Fernando Henrique Cardoso\\'s (FHC) Social \\nDemocracy Party of Brazil (PSDB) due to the economic problems he \\nbequeathed.  In issuing his \"Letter to the Brazilian People,\" \\npledging responsibility in economic management, Lula broke with many \\nPT economists and has never paid much attention to them since.  He \\nhas managed to retain his own popularity even while his party has \\nbeen seriously damaged by the political corruption scandals.  The PT \\nmay win as few as 45 seats in elections for the Chamber of Deputies, \\nNetto predicted. \\n \\n4.  (SBU) In the race for Sao Paulo Governor, Netto thought former \\nMayor Jose Serra was on track for a first-round victory.  This could \\n \\nSAO PAULO 00000907  002 OF 003 \\n \\n \\nchange, however, if PMDB candidate Orestes Quercia overtakes PT \\nSenator Aloysio Mercadante.  (NOTE: The most recent polls showed \\nSerra with 49 percent, Mercadante with 17 percent, and Quercia with \\n10 percent.  END NOTE.)  In that case, the well-organized PMDB could \\narouse the enthusiasm of its base and run an aggressive campaign \\nagainst Serra, focusing on his somewhat controversial record, and \\nforcing him into a second round. \\n \\n------------------------ \\nA SECOND LULA GOVERNMENT \\n------------------------ \\n \\n5. (SBU) Netto believes, as do many political observers, that many \\nof Lula\\'s social programs were designed to garner votes.  But he \\nalso said that Lula has genuine empathy for the poor and, if \\nre-elected, will devote his energies to trying to create more jobs. \\nHe is also likely, in Netto\\'s opinion, to keep on Central Bank \\nPresident Henrique Meirelles and to continue his orthodox \\nmacro-economic policies, but will exercise more flexibility and will \\nappoint other officials more open to lowering interest rates. \\n \\n6.  (SBU) Netto was somewhat cynical about the Congressional \\nelections, noting that many deputies implicated in the \"mensalao\" \\nscandal were running for re-elections and predicting that \"the ones \\nwho stole will be re-elected.\"  He noted that with the entry into \\nforce of the \"Barrier Clause,\" some four to six parties will \\ndisappear after failing to get five percent of the vote.  But many \\nof the members of these dying parties will join the government \\ncoalition, as will the PMDB, which will again elect around 80 \\ndeputies. \\n \\n------------------- \\nTHE NEED FOR REFORM \\n------------------- \\n \\n7.  (SBU) For the duration of the campaign, Netto predicted, neither \\nLula nor Alckmin will make much in the way of concrete proposals on \\nwhat programs they would undertake.  Doing so would gain them no \\nvoters and would likely cost them some.  Rather, they will campaign \\non generalities and platitudes, and will also expend some energy \\ntrying to \"deconstruct\" one another.  But whoever is in office in \\nJanuary will face certain hard realities, Netto pointed out.  A \\nSocial Security reform is urgently needed; without it, he said, \\nBrazil will soon face a fiscal crisis.  Labor reform is also \\ncritical.  However, Netto believed it would be difficult for a \\nPresident Alckmin to push such reforms through Congress, since the \\nPT and other leftist parties would vociferously oppose them. \\nHowever, if President Lula, coming off re-election, were to put them \\nforward, he could likely win leftist support (or, if not support, \\nacquiescence) for the measures, and even the opposition PSDB and \\nLiberal Front Party (PFL) would have to vote for some of the reforms \\non their merits.  For this reason, Netto said he himself will vote \\nfor Lula, because he believes Lula is in a better position to have a \\nsuccessful government. \\n \\n------- \\nCOMMENT \\n------- \\n \\n8.  (SBU) Netto\\'s stated reason for preferring Lula over Alckmin is \\nnovel and interesting (and likely self-serving), but begs the \\nquestion of whether a re-elected President Lula would in fact decide \\nto take on social security and labor reform, and other much-needed \\ninitiatives.  For many observers, Lula\\'s first term has lacked focus \\nand vision, which does not augur well for a serious reform agenda in \\nthe second term, since such an agenda would require Lula\\'s direct \\nand sustained attention and involvement in order to get it through \\n \\nSAO PAULO 00000907  003 OF 003 \\n \\n \\nan inherently fractious Congress.

       "      u'summary': u'Federal Deputy Delfim Netto predicted President Lula will win a \"fairly close\" election in the second round if he can avoid committing too many more gaffes. Lula\\'s Workers Party (PT), however, will take a serious hit because of corruption scandals and will end up with fewer than 50 Federal Deputies. However, the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), of which Netto is a recent member, will hold a bloc of about 80 seats and will ally with Lula\\'s administration to get jobs and other favors. Lula will be able to patch together enough support from smaller parties to get legislation passed. In fact, Netto said, Lula was perhaps the only one who could push critical legislation like social security reform and labor reform through the Congress. Leftist forces would accept such reforms if sponsored by Lula, but would oppose and ultimately defeat them if PSDB candidate Geraldo Alckmin won the presidency and tried to pursue such reforms. For this reason, Netto himself plans to vote for Lula. In a second administration, Netto predicted, Lula will continue his macro-economic orthodoxy but with more flexibility, leaving in place Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles while appointing other officials who will likely push down interest rates and promote pro-growth policies. In Sao Paulo state, Netto predicted that former Mayor Jose Serra will win the governorship in the first round, though scenarios could yet arise that might undermine his chances.',\n",

This report was prepared by \\nvisiting Embassy Poloff in Recife and cleared with AmConsul Recife. \\nEnd summary \\n \\n2.  (SBU) The re-election of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva \\nwill be a \"tragedy\" and his government will be so bad that he may \\nnot finish his term of office, according to former two-term \\nPernambuco governor Jarbas Vasconcelos, now running for the Senate. \\nJarbas did not specify how Lula4s second term might end prematurely, \\nbut he described a discouraging national political landscape during \\na meeting with Recife Principal Officer and visiting Embassy Poloff \\non September 5.  Jarbas retold a bit of the overthrow of Joao \\nGoulart by the Brazilian military in 1964, noting that Goulart had \\nsown the seeds of his government\\'s demise by undermining two pillars \\nthat were fundamental to military support: discipline and hierarchy. \\n But Jarbas said the end was provoked by two editorials in leading \\ndaily \"O Estado de Sao Paulo.\" By comparison, he noted, Lula has \\nsurvived a relentless and ongoing media attack and is heading for \\nre-election.  Jarbas did not say how Lula might be forced out before \\nthe end of his second term, but he seemed to be suggesting it would \\nbe a resignation in the face of overwhelming opposition. \\n \\n3.  (SBU) Jarbas said he believed that Lula will win re-election in \\nthe first round, but foresaw a very poor relationship with congress. \\n He predicted the PMDB, the PFL (Party of the Liberal Front) and \\nPSDB (Party of Brazilian Social Democracy) would each have 17 \\nsenators, or 51 out of 81 senate seats. He said Lula would not be \\nable to get along with such a congress.  Part of the PMDB supports \\nthe Lula government, while another faction remains in opposition; \\nJarbas did not say how many of the PMDB senators would be \\npro-government and how many opposition.  Jarbas also said the PSOL \\n(Party of Solidarity and Liberty), the far left party of Heloisa \\nHelena, the presidential candidate polling third at about ten \\npercent, would decline after the election. \\n \\n4.  (SBU) Many voters do not care enough about the corruption \\nscandals of Lula4s first term, Jarbas said, and they will vote for \\nLula.  Many of Lula4s supporters, especially those with little \\neducation, will vote loyally for the PT by choosing candidates on \\nthe ballot whose numbers start with 13, the PT\\'s number, he \\nexplained.  Because of this loyalty to the PT among the poor, Jarbas \\nsaid the PT block in Congress, currently just over 90 federal \\ndeputies and senators, will not be reduced by more than 10 or 15 \\nseats.  Jarbas also said Lula was running a good campaign, while \\nAlckmin\\'s campaign was weak.  The only one affected locally by \\ncorruption charges, in Jarbas\\' view, is Severino Cavalcanti, a \\nPernambuco politician who was forced to resign from the presidency \\nof the Chamber of Deputies for taking bribes from the congressional \\ncafeteria concession.  Jarbas expected an electoral defeat for him. \\n \\n \\n5.  (SBU) While most of the PMDB remains in Lula\\'s camp, Jarbas does \\nnot moderate his anti-Lula stance.  He was not always an \\nanti-Lulista: he said he recommended the PMDB cooperate with Lula in \\n2003 when Lula first took office, but the PMDB refused.  Jarbas, who \\nis as critical of his own party as he is of the Lula government, \\nsaid that refusal was strong evidence that the PMDB acted out of \\nself-interest regardless of what was good for Brazil.  Jarbas said \\nthe majority of the PMDB was \"rotten,\" and an ideological grab-bag \\n(\"a sack of cats\").  Still, he said he has not joined another party \\nbecause he does not have a PSDB \"profile,\" and he does not feel \\nclose enough to any other party to switch.  (Jarbas was elected \\ngovernor of Pernambuco in 1998 and re-elected in 2002 in the same \\n \\nBRASILIA 00001961  002 OF 002 \\n \\n \\nelection that brought Lula to power.  He resigned recently to run \\nfor the Senate.) \\n \\n6.  (SBU) Jarbas added that in 2003 he became aware of extensive \\ncorruption at a national level and warned his state government \\nadministrators to be on guard against it in Pernambuco.  Lula was \\nfully aware of all the corruption scandals, Jarbas was certain, \\nbecause there was rampant cronyism. \\n \\n7.  (U) Jarbas was confident of his own election to the senate and \\nsaid his polling shows he is at 66 percent with Pernambuco voters. \\n \\n8.  (SBU) Comment:  Some of Jarbas\\' observations struck us as \\nreasonable, except for the stunning and rather mysterious prediction \\nthat Lula might not finish his second term.  Coming from such a \\nlevel-headed and well-respected politician, Jarbas\\'s forecast of \\nstormy political weather ahead is a warning that political gridlock \\ncould revisit Brazil in one form or another in a second Lula \\npresidency. \\n \\n9.  (SBU) Comment continued.  Given Jarbas\\' long-time role in \\nNortheast politics and his good relations with Lula when he was \\ngovernor, his frank and negative comments came as a surprise.  He \\ntakes the role of the realist in politics, but he made very clear \\nthat he did not condone corrupt practices in any party.  He will \\nhave an interesting role to play in the Senate, and he believes that \\nhis vice governor, Jose Mendonca Filho, will take the election in \\nPernambuco and be his surrogate there. \\n \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

END \\nSUMMARY. \\n \\nFAITH IN THE PRESIDENT, NOT THE PARTY \\n------------------------------------- \\n \\n2.(U) The July 12 CNT-Sensus survey indicates that President \\nLula\\'s approval rating rose from 57% in May to 60% in July. \\nThe survey was conducted between July 5-7, following the \\nseries of corruption revelations that started on May 22, but \\nbefore some of the more recent revelations involving Lula\\'s \\nWorkers\\' Party (PT) (reftels).  When asked who was more \\ninvolved in the corruption scandals, the voters replied: \\nCongress (35%); the PT (31%); and Lula (12%).  Almost half of \\nthose surveyed--46%--felt Lula was unaware of the vote-buying \\nscheme, while 34% felt he knew about it.  The Sensus results \\ncoincided with the Ipsos-Opinion survey taken June 21-29 and \\npublished in the weekly Veja magazine.  According to this \\nsurvey, 45% said that \"Lula knew nothing about the corruption \\nscandal\"; 39% said he \"knew something but did nothing to \\ncorrect the situation\"; and only 16% thought that Lula \"knew \\nabout the scandal and was involved.\"  The Ipsos-Opinion \\nsurvey also found that 55% believed Lula to be an honest \\npolitician, while only 36% deemed the PT to be honest. \\nAccording to Sensus poll projections for the October 2006 \\nelections, Lula would defeat Jose Serra, PSDB mayor of Sao \\nPaulo and Lula\\'s opponent in 2002, by a margin of nearly 14 \\npoints. \\n \\nCOMMENT: \\n-------- \\n \\n3.(SBU) Despite the corruption scandal, Lula is riding out \\nthe storm, averaging approval ratings comparable to when he \\nfirst came into office.  These surveys indicate that his \\npersonal image has not yet been irreparably tarnished by the \\ncorruption scandal.  If he is successful in cleaning house \\nwith his ongoing cabinet shuffle (reftel 1867) and keeps the \\neconomy on track, his candidacy for the October 2006 election \\nshould remain viable.  This is assuming, though, that no new \\nrevelations emerge tying Lula more directly to the \\nimpropriety, and that continuous media coverage of the crisis \\ndoes not change voters\\' perception of their president\\'s \\ncredibility. \\nCHICOLA \\n',\n",

(U) SUMMARY:  On March 14, 2009 President Obama met with \\nPresident Lula of Brazil in Washington, D.C. at the White House and \\nthe meeting was covered extensively by the Brazilian media.  The \\nfollowing media reaction cable summarizes some of the Sao Paulo \\nbased Brazilian media reports published on Sunday, March 15.  The \\nsummaries focus on the economy, G-20, Sean Goldman case, the \\npersonal relationship between the two presidents and MFA-former \\nAmbassador comments. END SUMMARY \\n \\nObama and Lula Discuss Economy, Biofuels and G-20 \\n--------------- \\n2.  (U)  Main articles in Estado and Folha emphasize the agenda \\ndiscussed by Presidents Obama and Lula during their 2-hour meeting \\non Saturday- March 14.  According to reports, the presidents have \\nasked their high-level officials to develop a joint strategy to \\ncombat the global economic crisis in the upcoming weeks.  The \\nproposal is to be presented by the two leaders at the G-20 meeting \\nin April.  \"Obama\\'s proposal to form a Brazil-U.S. group in order to \\nwork jointly in the G-20 was extremely important,\" said President \\nLula in a press conference.  Folha highlights that President Obama \\ninvited Chief Economic Adviser Larry Summers to participate in the \\nmeeting.  Folha also noted that Obama defended the goal of a global, \\ncoordinated action in order to counter the current world recession. \\nLula once more declared that the U.S. is largely responsible for the \\nfinancial crisis and offered that [the U.S.] nationalizing banks is \\npart of the solution. \\n \\nFolha states that \"the alliance established between the world\\'s \\nrichest nation and Latin America\\'s largest economy around the \\neconomic crisis marks a new stage in the bilateral relations.\" \\nEstado and Folha say that Obama and Lula seemed at ease and in a \\ngood mood, exchanging jokes throughout the joint press availability. \\n But there were also disagreements when the issue of ethanol came \\nup.  Obama acknowledged that biofuels have been \"a source of tension \\nbetween the two countries.\"  Lula said he could not understand why a \\nclean fuel such as ethanol is heavily taxed, but added: \"I never \\nexpect an immediate answer. It is a process.\"  Obama agreed that the \\nissue is \"not going to change overnight.\"  According to Valor \\nEcontmico, Lula stated that associating ethanol in efforts to fight \\nglobal warming has become the most auspicious area to deepen \\nU.S.-Brazil relations. \\n \\nAccording to reports, Obama and Lula committed to fighting \\nprotectionism and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Foreign \\nMinister Celso Amorim will meet to discuss ways to do so. But the \\npresidents were pessimistic about advances in global trade.  \"Our \\ngoal is to at least not go backwards. It may be difficult for us to \\nfinalize a whole host of trade deals in the midst of an economic \\ncrisis like this one,\" Obama said. \\n \\nSources: Folha de S.Paulo A4: \"Obama and Lula discuss action to \\ncombat crisis and trade tension\"; O Estado de S.Paulo A4: \"Lula \\nmeets Obama and announces joint action for G-20 summit\"; O Estado de \\nS.Paulo A8: \"U.S. president warns that barriers to ethanol will not \\nbe lifted now\"; Valor Economico A3 (Monday edition): \"Lula-Obama \\nmeeting diminishes chances for Doha\" \\n \\nSean Goldman Case \\n--------------- \\n3.  (U)  Side stories say that during a press conference, President \\nLula confirmed that President Obama raised the topic of the Sean \\nGoldman case.  \"Obama thanked the Brazilian government\\'s actions \\nthat led to the case being heard by a Brazilian federal court.  We \\nhope that the judiciary does what it has to do; I am not a lawyer \\nand I cannot give an opinion.  Whatever decision is reached, the \\nBrazilian government will comply with it,\" stated Lula.  Folha also \\nmentions that while President Obama and President Lula met, a group \\nof supporters of David Goldman held a demonstration outside the \\nWhite House. \\n \\nSources: O Estado de S.Paulo A4: \"American mentions Sean case\"; \\nFolha de S.Paulo A14: \"Obama thanks Brazil for taking dispute over \\nboy to federal court\" \\n \\nObama- You must be talking to my wife \\n--------------- \\n4.  (U)  The two Folha articles state that the meeting between \\nPresident Obama and President Lula was surrounded by the same \\nexpectation from both sides: that it would mark the beginning of a \\ncordial and close relationship between the two leaders.  Stories \\nhighlight that President Lula was the third head of state to meet \\nPresident Obama at the White House.  Diplomats from both countries \\nsay the choice of meeting with Lula shows that Brazil is stable \\npolitically and economically; that it an undisputed leader in Latin \\nAmerica and also an emerging country in the global arena.  During \\nthe joint press avail, in what has been labeled a gaffe by the \\npress, Lula told reporters he did not want to be holding the \"hot \\npotato\" the U.S. president has in his hands, prompting Obama to \\nlaugh and tell Lula that  \"it sounds  like you\\'ve been talking to my \\nwife.\"  By-liners remembered that in 2007 President Lula caused then \\nPresident Bush to laugh when he stated that Brazil and the U.S. had \\nreached the \"G-spot\" of the bilateral relations. \\n \\nReports also quote President Obama saying he is looking forward to \\nvisiting Brazil and that he is aware he has many \"friends\" in the \\ncountry.  Asked about a date for the visit, Obama said nothing has \\nbeen decided yet, but as far as destinations go, he would like to \\nsee the \"beautiful beaches\" in Rio and perhaps do to the Amazon, \\njoking that Republicans probably would like to see him get lost \\nthere for a while. \\n \\nSources: Folha de S. Paulo A8: \"In the bilateral relations, out with \\nthe \\'G-spot\\' and in with the \\'hot potato\\'\"; Folha de S. Paulo A8: \\n\"Meeting allows presidents to become close\"; O Estado de S.Paulo: \\n\"You must be talking to my wife,\" jokes host. \\n \\nComments from MFA and former Brazilian Ambassadors \\n--------------- \\n5.  (U)  Estado story states that last week when trying to summarize \\nthe U.S.-Brazil bilateral relations, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim \\nacknowledged that the agenda has shown small progress, aside from \\nthe cooperation in the energy sector.  Paper says that the stall in \\nrelations dates to the Clinton-Cardoso era.  Estado points out that \\nsince Lula first met Bush in 2003 promising a successful conclusion \\nto the FTAA, the trade accord fell through the cracks, the Doha \\nRound \\'shows no vital signs\\' and Brazil had no other path to \\nnegotiate opening of the U.S. market.  Brazil\\'s claim for support \\ntowards a seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council has \\nalso gone unanswered, says story citing that when asked about it in \\n2006, A/S Thomas Shannon \"choked, took a step back, laughed and did \\nnot respond.\"  At the same time, Estado affirms that in 2005 the \\nWhite House unsuccessfully tried to engage Brazil in a partnership \\nto stop democracy from eroding in Latin America.  By refusing to \\nintervene, Brazil received the White House\\'s blessings to deal with \\nregional leaders, thus consolidating its hegemony in South America. \\n \\nTwo former Brazilian ambassadors to the U.S. --Roberto Abdenur and \\nRubens Barbosa-commented on the meeting between Presidents Obama and \\nLula.  Roberto Abdenur expressed optimism and said even if the two \\ndo not enjoy the same \"impressive chemistry\" displayed by Lula and \\nBush; the link between the two countries is determined more by \\nconcrete facts than by personal ties.  Abdenur also believes that \\nsince Brazil overcame the issue of the external debt, the U.S. \\nstarted regarding the country as a leader with the potential to \\nbecome a partner, thus becoming \"part of the solution.\"  Meanwhile, \\nRubens Barbosa states that he believes the meeting will not solve \\nthe pending issues between the two countries, but it positions \\nBrazil as a \"privileged interlocutor\" of the U.S. administration. \\n \\nSources:  O Estado de S.Paulo A8: \"Bilateral agenda suffers from \\nimmobility\"; Folha de S. Paulo A14: \"Former ambassador says meeting \\nhas a \\'symbolic value\\'\"; O Estado de S.Paulo A9: \"\\'Brazil is part of \\nthe solution for the U.S\\'\" \\nWHITE \\n',\n",

REASONS: 1.4 (B)(D). \\n \\n1. (C) Summary. Ambassador Sobel, who arrived in Brazil in \\nAugust, presented his credentials to President Lula da Silva \\non 7 November, in a ceremony long delayed by Brazil\\'s \\nelection campaign season.  The 30-minute meeting with Lula \\nwas positive and substantive, with warm atmospherics.  Prior \\nto the credential ceremony, Lula,s chief of staff, Gilberto \\nCarvalho, greeted the Ambassador personally, then later \\narranged for Mrs. Sobel to enter the meeting room for photos \\nwith Lula.  Through these gestures and Lula,s remarks in the \\nmeeting, we received a continuation of the message we have \\nbeen getting from the GOB since Lula,s re-election -- the \\nGOB wants to refocus on and intensify relations with us. Key \\npoints of the meeting follow in para 2.  End summary. \\n \\n2. (C) Ambassador Sobel, along with ambassadors from Namibia, \\nVietnam and Mexico, presented credentials on 7 November at \\nPlanalto Palace. (Note: Brazil\\'s foreign ministry (MRE) \\norganizes presentation of ambassadorial credentials into \\ngroups of four, based on order of arrival in country. End \\nnote.)  All of the 7 November group had been waiting several \\nmonths for the credentials ceremony, owing to repeated delays \\ncaused by Brazil\\'s presidential election season, which \\nconcluded with Lula\\'s re-election victory on 29 October. Each \\nambassador met separately with Lula, who determined the \\nlength of the conversation.  Lula conversed with Ambassador \\nfor approximately 30 minutes, and was accompanied by Foreign \\nMinister Celso Amorim and Presidential foreign policy advisor \\nMarco Aurelio Garcia.  Ambassador was accompanied in the \\nmeeting by A/DCM and Management Counselor, and later joined \\nby Mrs. Sobel for photos and to observe conclusion of the \\nceremony with Ambassador\\'s review of the palace guard.  Key \\npoints of the meeting with Lula follow below: \\n \\n--Bio-fuels:  Lula led with this and stayed with the subject \\nthroughout the first part of the conversation with \\nAmbassador.  Lula noted he had discussed bio-fuels \\nextensively with President Bush.  Lula stressed Brazil,s \\ndesire for partnerships with the USG and American firms in \\nthis, calling it a transformational technology that could \\ndramatically improve lives throughout the world. Lula noted \\nBrazil is bringing on line a total of 93 distilleries for \\nbio-fuel processing in the next years.  Ambassador Sobel \\nconfirmed President Bush\\'s keen attention to the issue, and \\npresented Lula with a photo, autographed by President Bush, \\nfrom the G-8 St. Petersburg ministerial, where Lula presented \\ninformation on Brazil\\'s bio-fuels program to the President. \\nAmbassador further explained that the USG continues to \\norganize its interagency to address bio-fuels in a \\ncomprehensive policy format, and that Under Secretary Josette \\nSheeran recently had been given the USG lead on bio-fuels and \\nis anxious to visit Brazil this year. \\n \\n--Visit to U.S.:  Lula noted that he spoken recently with \\nPresident Bush, who asked him to visit the U.S.  Lula \\nexpressed a desire to visit soon, though he quipped that he \\nworried about the cold in Washington.  Ambassador noted that \\nhe also had been in touch with the White House on the visit, \\nand made himself available to Lula and his chief of staff to \\ndiscuss windows of opportunity and venues. \\n \\n--Strategic relationship:  Lula noted that the GOB wants to \\nsend a new ambassador to Washington asap. (Note: Current MRE \\nUnder Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador Antonio de \\nAguiar Patriota has been presented for agrement vice \\nAmbassador Roberto Abdenur).  Lula seemed anxious to convey \\nthis as a positive signal.  Lula then made a strong and \\ndirect declaration: \"We intend to take all steps necessary to \\nmake clear, beyond any doubt, that the U.S. and Brazil have a \\nstrategic relationship.\"  Ambassador welcomed this, and \\nreplied that the USG is not concerned with Brazil\\'s \\n\"prioritization\" of its relations with countries, but rather \\nis focused on \"what we can do together.\"  In response, Lula \\nand Amorim simultaneously weighed in to dismiss media \\nspeculation that GOB foreign policy priorities remain focused \\non south-south relations.  Lula also noted that he wanted to \\nre-invigorate the working groups established in various areas \\nduring his official visit to Washington at the beginning of \\n \\nBRASILIA 00002352  002 OF 002 \\n \\n \\nhis first term. \\n \\n3. (C) Comment:  The reception at Planalto and the \\nconversation with Lula could not have been more positive.

The 30-minute meeting with Lula was positive and substantive, with warm atmospherics. Prior to the credential ceremony, Lula,s chief of staff, Gilberto Carvalho, greeted the Ambassador personally, then later arranged for Mrs. Sobel to enter the meeting room for photos with Lula. Through these gestures and Lula,s remarks in the meeting, we received a continuation of the message we have been getting from the GOB since Lula,s re-election -- the GOB wants to refocus on and intensify relations with us.

(C) Summary: PMDB Congressman and elder statesman Antonio \\nDelfim Netto told CG that while President Lula remains \\npersonally popular, he needs to start courting the PMDB and \\nthe smaller &left light8 parties if he hopes to get \\nre-elected in next October,s elections.  Netto said the \\nPSDB/PFL electoral alliance poses a formidable front that \\ncould defeat Lula in a likely second round, particularly if \\nthe PSDB chooses Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin as its \\ncandidate.  In contrast to the increasingly united PSDB/PFL \\nalliance, Netto noted that Lula has not taken any steps to \\nforge an alliance with the large, though divided, PMDB. (He \\ndownplayed the possibility of the PMDB selecting a viable \\npresidential candidate from its own ranks.)  Netto also \\ncriticized the PT,s political immaturity, pointing to the \\nrecent PT National Directorate,s public manifesto \\nchallenging Lula,s economic policy.  Netto said that while \\nLula was conservative by nature, he was unlikely to change \\nhis top foreign policy advisers, whom he characterized as \\ninstinctively anti-American.  He also ruled out any dramatic \\nforeign policy changes in a second-term Lula government, \\naverring that the Foreign Ministry would continue to reflect \\nthe PT,s antipathy towards an FTAA and a more strategic \\nrelationship with the United States.  End Summary. \\n \\n2. (C) CG and Poloff met December 13 with Federal Deputy \\nAntonio Delfim Netto to discuss Brazil,s political and \\neconomic situation and the upcoming elections.  Netto, who \\nserved as Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning in the \\n1970s and  80s, enjoys a reputation as balanced and credible \\nelder statesman. While his party forms part of the governing \\ncoalition, Netto was surprisingly candid and critical of the \\nruling PT and some key aspects of Lula,s policies. \\n \\n3.  (C) Netto, who in recent months joined the Brazilian \\nDemocratic Movement Party (PMDB) after years as a member of \\nthe Progressivist Party (PP), characterized the PMDB as \\n&two-headed.8  There is a significant pro-government \\nfaction, as well as an anti-government faction which is \\nhighly critical of the Lula government but which also depends \\non the government for favors (The independent-minded Netto \\ndoes not fit neatly into either camp).  In the face of these \\ninternal divisions, the PMDB must decide whether to select \\nits own presidential candidate or, if Lula appears a likely \\nwinner, cut a deal to support Lula. \\n \\n4. (C) Netto opined that after all the scandals it has \\nsuffered, Lula,s Workers, Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores \\n) PT) will do well to elect 40 deputies in the October 2006 \\nelection, he opined (it currently has 90).  He said support \\nfrom the PMDB would be critical to Lula,s reelection bid \\nbecause the PMDB has many strong gubernatorial candidates who \\ncould provide crucial coattails.  Netto faulted Lula for not \\ntaking any early steps to forge a strong PT-PMDB alliance. As \\na result, some PMDB leaders are pressing for the party to run \\nits own presidential candidate. \\n \\n5. (C) Netto dismissed the likelihood of the PMDB fielding a \\nviable presidential candidate, noting that Supreme Federal \\nTribunal (STF)President Nelson Jobim is unlikely to garner \\nsufficient party support.  Similarly, Rio Grande do Sul \\nGovernor Germano Rigotto is &extraordinary8 but lacks the \\nnational exposure needed to make a successful run.  Netto \\ncharacterized former Rio de Janeiro Governor Anthony \\nGarotinho as a dangerous populist, whose main support comes \\nfrom evangelical Christians. \\n \\n6. (C) Netto noted that the PSDB and PFL appear increasingly \\nunited and thus pose a credible challenge for Lula.  Sao \\nPaulo Mayor Jose Serra (PSDB) is a tough and seasoned \\ncandidate who has national recognition.  Netto, however, \\nconsiders Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin (also \\nPSDB) an even greater threat to Lula,s reelection bid. \\nAlckmin is a respected and able administrator who would be a \\nvery strong candidate, although Netto acknowledged that Serra \\nwould be tough to beat for the PSDB nomination. \\n \\n7. (C) Netto offered candid opinions on Lula and the PT.  The \\nparty,s National Directorate,s recent manifesto criticizing \\nthe government,s economic policy exposed the party,s \\npolitical immaturity.  The Directorate has always been more \\nof an academic center or discussion group, creating many \\ninternal fissures and tensions.  Lula won the 2002 election \\nbased on his personal popularity and his ability to attract \\nstrong support from outside the PT.  He,s not a leftist at \\nheart, but rather a culturally conservative Catholic labor \\nleader with good political instincts.  In contrast to Lula,s \\npolitical pragmatism, others in the PT and government are \\n&revolutionaries who want to change the world.8 \\n \\n8. (C) According to Netto, Lula is dealing with a difficult \\neconomic situation that he inherited from former President \\nFernando Henrique Cardoso:  a high tax burden, a fiscal \\ndeficit, and a high debt-to-GDP ratio.  The Central Bank has \\nexacerbated the situation by keeping interest rates too high, \\ninhibiting growth.  These problems are hard to correct in the \\nshort term, particularly with the continuing investigations \\nsurrounding the political scandals, which are a complicating \\nLula,s situation. Despite losing some support inside and \\noutside of his party, Lula will benefit from the &Bolsa \\nFamilia8 welfare program, which should garner crucial blocs \\nof votes in the impoverished north and northeastern parts of \\nBrazil.  Also, Lula is a charismatic speaker who is able to \\ncapture the popular vote without being a populist. \\n \\n9. (C) Commenting on the Lula government,s foreign policy, \\nNetto sharply criticized the Foreign Ministry (Itamaraty) for \\nideologically driven policies that do not reflect the \\ncountry,s national interests.  He attributed these \\nmisdirected policies to leftist, anti-American ideologues in \\nsenior positions, such as MFA Secretary General Samuel \\nPinheiro Guimaraes and presidential adviser Marco Aurelio \\nGarcia.  Netto said FTAA is absolutely essential to \\nstrengthening economic ties, stimulating investment and \\nbringing in partnerships and joint ventures, but believes \\nthere will not be any progress on FTAA as long as Guimarees \\nand Garcia are directing Lula,s foreign policies.  According \\nto Netto, Garcia and Guimaraes wield tremendous influence \\nover Lula even though he doesn,t share their political \\noutlook or temperament.  Netto averred that both will likely \\ncontinue in their positions should Lula win a second term, \\nadding that Brazil,s foreign policy is unlikely to change \\ncourse with respect to the United States.  (He described the \\nbilateral relationship as &friendly but superficial.8) \\nDespite these obstacles at the governmental level, Netto said \\nmuch can be done in terms of outreach to strengthen \\nunderstanding between the U.S. and Brazil, which share many \\ncommon interests. \\n \\n10.   (C) Comment: Netto is a prominent economist by training \\nwho has been in public life for over 40 years.  He held a \\nnumber of senior governmental positions under the military \\ndictatorship and has been a Federal Deputy since 1987.  He is \\na well-informed, articulate and candid observer whose views \\nare not infused with strong political partisanship.  However, \\nhe only recently joined the PMDB and does not wield strong \\ninfluence in the party.  Thus, his (implied) preference for \\nanalliance between the PMDB and Lula may not reflect party \\nleadership thinking.  Other PMDB representatives we have \\nspoken to recently ) for example, Sao Paulo state party \\nchairman Orestes Quercia ) strongly favor having the PMDB \\nrun its own presidential candidate, though preferably not \\nGarotinho.  Given the deep divisions in the PMDB at the \\nnational level, it would be difficult for the party to field \\na viable presidential candidate. For this reason, Netto \\nbelieves it would be more advantageous politically for the \\nPMDB to strike a strategic deal with Lula and the PT, even if \\nthis means accepting some policies that do not sit well with \\nthe PMDB rank and file.   End comment. \\n \\n11.  (U) This message was cleared/coordinated with Embassy \\nBrasilia. \\nMCMULLEN \\n',\n",

Sobel, Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) \\n \\n1. (C) In a meeting with Ambassador Sobel March 28, British \\nAmbassador to Brazil Alan Charlton provided a readout of the \\nMarch 26 meeting between Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula \\nda Silva and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  Charlton \\nsaid that the economic crisis was the principal topic of \\nconversation, with Brown pushing for Brazil to participate in \\nthe efforts to increase financing, specifically through the \\nIMF New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB).  Lula was \\nnon-committal.  Lula told Brown that whatever new \\norganization (e.g., G-20, G-8 plus 5) emerges from current \\ndiscussions, Brazil will participate. \\n \\n2. (C) Brown and Lula also discussed working together to help \\nthe global community understand that the Doha trade round can \\nbe part of the solution to the current crisis.  Lula asked \\nabout Europe\\'s support for restarting Doha.  Brown said that \\nFrance and Germany could be convinced, but only if the United \\nStates shows interest in restarting talks within the next six \\nmonths. \\n \\n3. (C) According to Charlton, other topics raised were: \\n \\n--Climate Change: Brown also pushed for a \"more realistic\" \\napproach by Brazil to climate change, i.e., one that involves \\ntaking on commitments.  According to Charlton, when Foreign \\nMinister Celso Amorim tried to intervene regarding \\ndifferentiated responsibilities, Lula cut him off. \\n \\n-- WTO Appellate Body: Lula brought up with Brown Brazil\\'s \\ncandidate for the WTO court, Supreme Court Justice Ellen \\nGracie Northfleet, saying he intended to raise her nomination \\nwith President Obama as well. \\n \\n-- Nuclear Non-Proliferation: Brown raised concerns regarding \\nthe doctoral thesis of a Brazilian Army nuclear physicist, \\nDalton Barroso, that reportedly addresses how to develop a \\nnuclear weapons program.  (Note: The Brazilian MOD has \\nrefused to allow Barroso to be interviewed by the IAEA about \\nhis ideas. End note.) \\n \\n-- UNSC: Lula aggressively pushed Brazil\\'s interest in a \\npermanent UN Security Council seat.  Brown confirmed that \\nboth France and Britain support Brazil. \\n \\n-- Food Security: Brown and Lula discussed food security in \\nAfrica.  According to Charlton, Lula was very engaged, and \\nthere was agreement to seek ways to work together via the \\nBritish Development Ministry and Brazil\\'s Cooperation Agency \\n(ABC). \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

(SBU) Summary.  In a rare meeting granted by President Lula to a \\nUS congressional delegation, President Lula told CoDel Hoyer April 8 \\nthat he has high expectations of the Obama administration, sees a \\nnew era in U.S. relations with Latin America, and hopes for a \\npositive gesture on Cuba at the Summit of the Americas.  Lula \\nstressed the importance of direct leader involvement in the Doha \\nRound to produce a successful outcome, urged the United States to \\nbegin a new relationship with Venezuela, and said he would go to \\nIran soon because Brazil sees value in dialogue with Iran and has \\npolitical and economic interests there.  He urged the creation of a \\nregular bilateral U.S.-Brazil congressional exchange, especially on \\nenergy.  He described a financial aid program for low-income college \\nstudents.  Septels will report on other Codel meetings.  End \\nsummary \\n \\nHoyer:  Brazil is important \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n2. (SBU) Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman Lucille \\nRoybal-Allard, Congressman Elijah Cummings, Congressman Gregory \\nMeeks, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Congressman Adrian \\nSmith, Congressman Gerry Connolly, Congressman Aaron Schock, \\nstaffers Mariah Sixkiller and Brian Diffell, Charge Lisa Kubiske, \\nand Poloff (notetaker) met on April 8 with President Lula, who was \\naccompanied by Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia, Deputy \\nForeign Policy Advisor Marcel Biato, and Foreign Policy Unit aide \\nElio Cardoso. \\n \\n3. (SBU) Congressman Hoyer told President Lula that the delegation \\nhad come to Brazil because of Brazil\\'s extraordinary importance. \\nHoyer noted Lula\\'s achievements as president, Brazil\\'s hemispheric \\nand global role, and its critical role in the G-20.   President \\nObama recognizes Brazil\\'s importance: Lula was the first Latin \\nAmerican leader he met with, which was an important signal, and \\nBrazil and the United States must be partners, Hoyer said. \\nPresidents Obama and Lula, together with their colleagues, have an \\nopportunity to confront major problems such as the economy, the \\nenvironment, and hunger, Hoyer told the president, and thanked him \\nfor his role in the region. \\n \\nLula: \"New Era\" in U.S.-Latin American Relations \\n- - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n4.  (SBU) A wide-ranging conversation that was to have lasted 30 \\nminutes but stretched to 90 followed Hoyer\\'s opening remarks, \\npeppered with Lula\\'s characteristic personal anecdotes and jokes. \\nLula opened by declaring, \"I have a conviction - it is pure \\nintuition - that Obama may set out a new era in U.S.-Latin American \\nrelations and U.S.-African relations.\"  He pointed to a time of \\nopportunity for President Obama, saying the situation in the region \\nis now \"totally changed\" from the past, when \"mistaken policies in \\nLatin America,\" armed struggles and other things that took place \\nduring the Cold War caused anti-Americanism in the region. \\n \\nLatin America Has Changed \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n5.  (SBU) Latin America has undergone a profound change, he \\nexplained, and credited the Sao Paulo Forum, founded in 1990 by the \\nWorkers\\' Party, as the starting point that brought regional leftist \\ngroups together and set them on a path of attaining power through \\npeaceful political activity.  This mainstreaming has today borne \\nfruit in the election of leftist leaders throughout the region, Lula \\nsaid, including himself, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and \\nmany others, and, most recently, Mauricio Funes of El Salvador.  He \\nsaid all those who formerly professed mass struggle are organizing \\npolitical parties today, concluding, \"We proved that the easiest way \\nto power was through elections.\" \\n \\n6.  (SBU) Lula said the inspiration for convening the Forum came \\nafter he had turned around his flagging presidential campaign in \\n1989 and made it to the second round of the election.  \"Never in \\nLatin America had a lathe operator gotten so far,\" he told the \\nvisiting congressmen, \"and because we had come out stronger, I \\ndecided to call in all the leftist parties from Latin America.\"  He \\nnoted that almost all of them have by now come into power.  Asked \\nwhether he was responsible for all this, Lula pointed at his foreign \\npolicy adviser, Marco Aurelio Garcia, and replied half-jokingly, \\n\"He, more than I.\" \\n \\nBRASILIA 00000445  002 OF 004 \\n \\n \\n \\n7.  (SBU) Still, Lula said, the \"prejudices\" of the Cold War period \\npersist, but personal relationships can solve problems that email \\nand faxes cannot. Only personal chemistry can solve problems.  He \\nsaid President Obama could do more than he was able to in six years, \\nand he is already getting started. \\n \\nWe are all interdependent \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n8.  (SBU) Congressman Hoyer observed that President Obama can \\nbenefit from Lula\\'s experience and that one country alone can no \\nlonger stabilize the world.  Lula agreed and stated, \"Today we all \\ndepend a little on China,\" half-jokingly recalling the amount of \\n\"Made in China\" goods he has seen in U.S. stores.  \"Trade has made \\nus all more interdependent,\" he concluded. \\n \\nRelationship with Bush could not have been better \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n9.  (SBU) Lula said his relationship with President George W. Bush \\nwas very respectful and could not have been better.  He recalled \\ntheir first meeting:  Bush was focused on Iraq, war, and \\noverthrowing Saddam Hussein.  Lula replied, telling Bush his own war \\nwas not with Iraq, but with poverty and hunger.  At the time, Lula \\nrecalled, he was sure Iraq had no chemical weapons, and a senior \\nBrazilian member of the weapons inspections team had been pulled out \\nat U.S. insistence because he also believed there were no chemical \\nweapons.  On the other hand, Lula observed, Saddam Hussein was a \\n\"madman who didn\\'t have the courage to admit that he didn\\'t have the \\nweapons.\" \\n \\nObama will be extraordinary \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n10.  (SBU) Returning to Obama, Lula said he believes U.S. foreign \\npolicy is becoming more proactive yet without being a \"mere \\ninterference in other countries\\' affairs.\"  Obama will be \\nextraordinary, in part for the things we share.  He can make a big \\ndifference, especially in relations with smaller countries.  Africa, \\nfor example, needs to develop or its rapidly increasing populations \\nwill emigrate to developed countries such as the United States. \\nLula said he believes leaders of developed countries need to visit \\nAfrica to understand its realities, noting that he has visited 23 \\nAfrican countries. \\n \\nLula to Obama: Use Political Capital to do the Necessary \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n11. (SBU) Politics is a perverse business, Lula explained, and one\\'s \\nfortunes rise and fall quickly, so Obama must use his political \\ncapital now to do what must be done.  Leaders, in his view, must \\nbecome personally involved in the Doha Round, the G-8, the G-14, the \\nG-20, and the Summit of the Americas in order to break free from the \\nbureaucratic machinery of advisers and ministries and bring true \\nadvances.  He said he had warned Obama of the danger of \"being \\nswallowed by the machine,\" which he likened to Chaplin\\'s \"Modern \\nTimes.\" \\n \\nDoha Round \\n- - - - - - \\n \\n12. (SBU) In reply to Congressman Meeks\\'s question about the Doha \\nRound, Lula said it was necessary to \"take it back from technicians\" \\nand let the politicians take over to get beyond technical details \\nand reach a decision at the political level.  He said he agreed with \\nPresident Sarkozy\\'s suggestion of a leaders\\' discussion at the G-8 \\nin Rome next June, was convinced that the United States did not have \\nto give up anything to reach success and it would be good for the \\npoorest countries. \\n \\nThe Summit of the Americas...and Cuba, Venezuela \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n13.  (SBU) Asked about the upcoming Summit of the Americas, Lula \\nnoted that the declaration has already been completed.  Lula \\ncharacterized the Summit as a leftover from the failed FTAA process \\nand said both the Summit of the Americas and the Ibero-American \\nSummit no longer have much meaning because they are so scripted. \\n \\nBRASILIA 00000445  003 OF 004 \\n \\n \\nThe proof is that the economic crisis will not even be mentioned in \\nPort of Spain. \\n \\n14.  (SBU) Cuba will be raised at the Summit of the Americas, but no \\none wants Obama to be embarrassed over Cuba, least of all the \\nCubans, Lula noted, because that would strengthen U.S. hardliners. \\nLula expects a peaceful summit without any verbal attacks on the \\nPresident over Cuba.  There is hope in Latin America for a change in \\nU.S. policy on Cuba; expectations are so high that if Obama is \\nsilent on Cuba at the SOA it will cause frustration.  Other leaders \\nsuch as Calderon of Mexico, Preval of Haiti and Uribe of Colombia \\nwill make statements on Cuba.  \"Let\\'s break the taboo...We need to \\nsolve the problem with Cuba.  Let\\'s establish a new U.S.-Cuban \\nrelationship,\" he proposed.  Obama should make a positive gesture \\ntowards Cuba such as allowing all American citizens to visit Cuba. \\n(Note: Coincidentally, the CoDel\\'s meeting came only hours after an \\nunannounced meeting between Lula and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno \\nRodriguez.  End note.) \\n \\n15.  (SBU) Asked whether Hugo Chavez would not attack Obama at the \\nSummit, Lula said he thinks not.  He added that criticism and \\nprovocation of Chavez are not constructive and only strengthen \\nChavez.  In Lula\\'s view, U.S.-Venezuelan relations are like \"a fight \\nbetween a husband and wife.\"  \"The fight may have been pleasant for \\na while, but no longer is.\"  Obama can start a new relationship with \\nVenezuela, and the U.S. and Venezuela should exchange ambassadors, \\nLula stated. \\n \\nIran \\n- - - \\n \\n16. (SBU) Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz urged Lula to \"go \\nslow\" on Iran.  Lula replied that he regrets not having gone to Iran \\nearlier because President Ahmadinejad needs to hear points of view \\nother than those of Daniel Ortega and Hugo Chavez.  He is going to \\nIran (though probably not until after the elections there), he said, \\nbecause Brazil has political and economic interests there and Iran \\nis important to Brazil and important in the region.  Lula said \\nBrazil has always had a good trade relationship with Iran, although \\ngreatly in Brazil\\'s favor, and he would discuss nuclear energy with \\nIran.  (Note: Following the March visit of Iran\\'s foreign minister \\nto Brasilia, senior GOB officials have confirmed that a visit by \\nIranian President Ahmadinejad to Brazil is in the works, perhaps as \\nearly as May.  Brazilian engagement with Iran should be viewed in \\nthe context of Brazil\\'s south-south diplomatic outreach, since in \\nLula\\'s view there is value for Brazil in dialogue with Iran that \\ngoes beyond commercial interests.  Charge heard a similar view on \\nApril 8 from Ambassador Roberto Jaguaribe, Under Secretary for \\nPolitical Affairs at the Ministry for External Relations, who \\nemphasized the importance of direct dialogue with Iran, noting that \\n\"peripheral\" countries should talk to and exchange information with \\neach other directly and not through the United States or Europe \\n(septel). End note.) \\n \\nCongressional Exchanges \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - \\n \\n17.  (SBU) President Lula noted the absence of a strong relationship \\nbetween our congresses and encouraged the U.S. members of congress \\nto work toward the creation of a regular, institutionalized, \\nbilateral congressional exchange.  He suggested energy as an \\nappropriate focus.  Congressman Hoyer said he would follow up. \\n \\n18.  (U) Finally, Lula told the delegation about Pro-Uni (University \\nfor All Program), an educational initiative to help underprivileged \\nstudents.  Lula explained that under Pro-Uni the GOB grants a tax \\nexemption to private universities, which in turn contribute the \\nvalue of the exemption to a scholarship fund for poor and black \\nstudents in private universities.  Students must have attended a \\npublic school in order to receive benefits.  Lula said 56,000 \\nstudents from poor communities, 40% of them black, have graduated \\nfrom colleges because of Pro-Uni, today 45% of students in private \\nuniversities are black, and Pro-Uni represents a revolution for \\nBrazil.  Congressman Hoyer replied that private universities in the \\nUnited States are already tax exempt and the government assists low \\nincome students through the Pell Grant program, which has been \\nexpanded in recent years.  (Background note: Public universities in \\nBrazil are free and admission is competitive.  Students who graduate \\nfrom public high schools, which are generally inferior to private \\n \\nBRASILIA 00000445  004 OF 004 \\n \\n \\nschools, are less well prepared for the entrance exams than private \\nschool graduates.  As a result, public school graduates, who come \\nfrom the poorest Brazilian families, are the least able to pay \\ntuition, are disproportionately black and mulatto, but generally \\nmust attend private universities -- or no university -- while those \\nwhose families could afford private school attend tuition-free \\npublic universities.  Pro-Uni was designed to address this \\nsituation.  End background note.) \\n \\n19.  (SBU) Embassy Comment: Lula had not received a U.S. \\ncongressional delegation in at least three years, and his decision \\nto receive the Hoyer delegation signals a greater receptiveness and \\nmore positive evaluation of the value of such contacts on the part \\nof the Presidential Palace.  End Embassy comment. \\n \\n20. (U) The Hoyer delegation has cleared this message. \\n \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

(SBU) SUMMARY.  The large PMDB party decided at a December \\n12 convention to defect from the governing coalition of \\nBrazilian President Lula da Silva.  The decision exacerbated \\nthe rift between the party\\'s pro- and anti-government wings, \\nbut as the dust settles it appears that Lula could benefit \\nfrom the crisis.  Lula plans to keep the two PMDB members in \\nhis cabinet and will continue to collaborate with the \\npro-government PMDB members of Congress.  This posture has \\nhelped to solidify the party\\'s pro-government wing, and Lula \\ncan now reasonably count on most of the PMDB votes in both \\nhouses.  The crisis may not play out until February, but with \\nthe administration and savvy PMDB Senator Jose Sarney working \\nagainst the withdrawal from the coalition (and the \\nanti-government wing making tactical blunders), Lula may well \\nturn the crisis in his favor.  END SUMMARY. \\n \\n2. (SBU) The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement \\n(PMDB) is being derided as the \"Party of the Brazilian \\nDisorganized Mix-ups\".  The anti-government wing forced a \\nvote at a December 12 party convention to pull out of Lula\\'s \\ncoalition (reftel).  By this, party leaders hoped to \\nestablish themselves as \"independent\" of Lula\\'s Workers\\' \\nParty (PT) so that they can run against Lula and the PT\\'s \\nother candidates in the 2006 elections.  However, those party \\nleaders are now on the defensive as the pro-government wing \\nhas united in a counter-attack supported by the \\nadministration. \\n \\nPMDB CAUCUS IN CONGRESS SWINGS TOWARD LULA \\n------------------------------------------ \\n3. (SBU) In Congress, leading PMDB Senators Jose Sarney and \\nRenan Calheiros have finally buried the hatchet on their \\ndispute over who will be the next Senate President (it will \\nlikely be Calheiros).  Their reconciliation brought together \\nthe PMDB caucus in the Senate so that 20 of the party\\'s 23 \\nSenators are now counted as pro-government.  Sarney\\'s \\nsupport, in particular, is key.  His political instincts are \\nunrivalled, and he is a devoted government ally who can pull \\ninnumerable strings on Lula\\'s behalf (but on the few \\noccasions that he has been irritated with the administration, \\nhe has caused it to lose key floor votes).  In the lower \\nhouse, the picture is similar.  The party\\'s pro-government \\nfaction in the Chamber showed its teeth December 15 in \\ncollecting 47 votes (of the party\\'s 78 Deputies) to retain \\npro-government Deputy Jose Borba as party whip.  Thus the \\npro-Lula faction owns a solid majority of the party caucus in \\nboth houses. \\n \\nTEMER\\'S FAILED MOVE TO EXPEL DISSIDENTS \\n--------------------------------------- \\n4. (SBU)  As a key coalition member, the PMDB nominated two \\ncabinet ministers and several other senior administration \\nofficials.  In the wake of the party\\'s withdrawal from the \\ncoalition, PMDB president Michel Temer, who leads the party\\'s \\nanti-government bloc, ordered these officials to quit their \\nposts.  They refused, and Temer moved to expel them from the \\nparty.  Those threatened with expulsion are:  Communications \\nMinister Eunicio Oliveira, Social Security Minister Amir \\nLando, Director of the Social Security Agency (INSS) Carlos \\nBezerra, Director of Petrobras\\'s transportation unit \\n(Transpetro) Sergio Machado, and Director of the Postal \\nSystem (Correios) Joao Henrique de Almeida.  But the battle \\nis also being waged in the courts, and Temer\\'s move was \\nshort-circuited by a judge\\'s decision that declared the \\nentire PMDB convention void.  Thus, the party members who \\nhold posts in Lula\\'s administration will defy Temer and keep \\ntheir jobs.  As a tactical matter, Temer\\'s move to expel the \\nfive was a failed show of strength that backfired and may \\ncost him dearly as events unfold. \\n \\nLULA CAPITALIZING ON THE SITUATION \\n---------------------------------- \\n5. (SBU) The day after the December 12 party convention, Lula \\nmet with the PMDB\\'s pro-government leaders and reportedly \\noffered them behind-the-scenes support to replace Temer with \\nSarney as party president in mid-2005.  In the meantime, Lula \\nwill seek to exploit the party\\'s divisions by working \\nexclusively with the pro-government faction, offering support \\nand pork spending to its congressional bloc, and keeping the \\ntwo PMDB cabinet ministers in place.  Lula pointedly said \\nthis week that he plans no cabinet shuffle until January at \\nthe earliest. \\n \\nCOMMENT \\n------- \\n6. (SBU)  Senator Jose Sarney and the pro-government wing of \\nthe PMDB are counter-attacking, and Sarney is a formidable \\ntactician who has already managed to forge a weighty support \\nbloc in Congress.  Party President Michel Temer and the \\nanti-government wing have the support of the large party \\ndelegations from Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and a handful of \\nother key states that have never been comfortable in Lula\\'s \\ncamp.  Both sides will continue to maneuver, but in the \\nshort-term, Lula will to treat the pro-government wing as a \\ncoalition member (and will retain his PMDB cabinet \\nministers).  Congress will go out of session by December 30, \\nso the crisis may not play out until February or March. \\nSenator Jorge Bornhausen (president of the opposition PFL \\nparty) notes with dismay that the crisis has had the effect \\nof clearly defining the  PMDB\\'s internal rift and making its \\npro-government wing more committed to Lula.  Thus, he \\npredicts, the work of the opposition may become more \\ndifficult in the coming year because it will be harder to \\npick off disaffected PMDB members during votes.  On the other \\nhand, Rio Mayor Cesar Maia, also of the PFL, commented in the \\npress that \"the PMDB is a rare case of a party that gets \\nstronger with disunity.  As the sides become defined, the \\ngovernment and opposition wings get stronger through \\nbargaining.  When it is united, the party is weaker.\" \\nDANILOVICH \\n',\n",

       "      u'summary': u\"The large PMDB party decided at a December 12 convention to defect from the governing coalition of Brazilian President Lula da Silva. The decision exacerbated the rift between the party's pro- and anti-government wings, but as the dust settles it appears that Lula could benefit from the crisis. Lula plans to keep the two PMDB members in his cabinet and will continue to collaborate with the pro-government PMDB members of Congress. This posture has helped to solidify the party's pro-government wing, and Lula can now reasonably count on most of the PMDB votes in both houses. The crisis may not play out until February, but with the administration and savvy PMDB Senator Jose Sarney working against the withdrawal from the coalition (and the anti-government wing making tactical blunders), Lula may well turn the crisis in his favor.\",\n",

(SBU) Federal Deputy Delfim Netto predicted President Lula will \\nwin a \"fairly close\" election in the second round if he can avoid \\ncommitting too many more gaffes.  Lula\\'s Workers Party (PT), \\nhowever, will take a serious hit because of corruption scandals and \\nwill end up with fewer than 50 Federal Deputies.  However, the \\ncentrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), of which Netto \\nis a recent member, will hold a bloc of about 80 seats and will ally \\nwith Lula\\'s administration to get jobs and other favors.  Lula will \\nbe able to patch together enough support from smaller parties to get \\nlegislation passed.  In fact, Netto said, Lula was perhaps the only \\none who could push critical legislation like social security reform \\nand labor reform through the Congress.  Leftist forces would accept \\nsuch reforms if sponsored by Lula, but would oppose and ultimately \\ndefeat them if PSDB candidate Geraldo Alckmin won the presidency and \\ntried to pursue such reforms.  For this reason, Netto himself plans \\nto vote for Lula.  In a second administration, Netto predicted, Lula \\nwill continue his macro-economic orthodoxy but with more \\nflexibility, leaving in place Central Bank President Henrique \\nMeirelles while appointing other officials who will likely push down \\ninterest rates and promote pro-growth policies.  In Sao Paulo state, \\nNetto predicted that former Mayor Jose Serra will win the \\ngovernorship in the first round, though scenarios could yet arise \\nthat might undermine his chances.  END SUMMARY. \\n \\n--------------------------------------------- - \\nLULA EXPECTED TO WIN A \"FAIRLY CLOSE\" ELECTION \\n--------------------------------------------- - \\n \\n2.  (SBU) In a recent meeting with Poloff and Political Assistant, \\nAntonio Delfim Netto (reftel), an elder statesman of Brazil\\'s \\npolitical class, shared his predictions for the electoral campaign. \\nNetto expects that opposition candidate Geraldo Alckmin will narrow \\nthe gap separating him from President Lula and force the election \\ninto a second round.  Lula is probably at his ceiling right now, \\nwhereas Alckmin has plenty of room to grow.  Third-party candidate \\nHeloisa Helena will also rise above her current 10 percent, Netto \\npredicted, because her brand of radical socialism mixed with \\nChristianity appeals to many voters on the fringes.  However, faced \\nwith the prospect of an Alckmin victory, many such voters will opt \\nfor Lula in the second round, and he should win a narrow victory. \\nLula\\'s greatest challenge between now and the election, in Netto\\'s \\nview, will be to avoid saying things that may alienate voters (e.g., \\nrecent gaffe of his was interpreted by many as denigrating the \\nintelligence of the elderly). \\n \\n3.  (SBU) Netto noted that in 2002, Lula had carried his Workers \\nParty (PT) to power, not the other way around.  The 2002 elections \\nrepresented a vote against Fernando Henrique Cardoso\\'s (FHC) Social \\nDemocracy Party of Brazil (PSDB) due to the economic problems he \\nbequeathed.  In issuing his \"Letter to the Brazilian People,\" \\npledging responsibility in economic management, Lula broke with many \\nPT economists and has never paid much attention to them since.  He \\nhas managed to retain his own popularity even while his party has \\nbeen seriously damaged by the political corruption scandals.  The PT \\nmay win as few as 45 seats in elections for the Chamber of Deputies, \\nNetto predicted. \\n \\n4.  (SBU) In the race for Sao Paulo Governor, Netto thought former \\nMayor Jose Serra was on track for a first-round victory.  This could \\n \\nSAO PAULO 00000907  002 OF 003 \\n \\n \\nchange, however, if PMDB candidate Orestes Quercia overtakes PT \\nSenator Aloysio Mercadante.  (NOTE: The most recent polls showed \\nSerra with 49 percent, Mercadante with 17 percent, and Quercia with \\n10 percent.  END NOTE.)  In that case, the well-organized PMDB could \\narouse the enthusiasm of its base and run an aggressive campaign \\nagainst Serra, focusing on his somewhat controversial record, and \\nforcing him into a second round. \\n \\n------------------------ \\nA SECOND LULA GOVERNMENT \\n------------------------ \\n \\n5. (SBU) Netto believes, as do many political observers, that many \\nof Lula\\'s social programs were designed to garner votes.  But he \\nalso said that Lula has genuine empathy for the poor and, if \\nre-elected, will devote his energies to trying to create more jobs. \\nHe is also likely, in Netto\\'s opinion, to keep on Central Bank \\nPresident Henrique Meirelles and to continue his orthodox \\nmacro-economic policies, but will exercise more flexibility and will \\nappoint other officials more open to lowering interest rates. \\n \\n6.  (SBU) Netto was somewhat cynical about the Congressional \\nelections, noting that many deputies implicated in the \"mensalao\" \\nscandal were running for re-elections and predicting that \"the ones \\nwho stole will be re-elected.\"  He noted that with the entry into \\nforce of the \"Barrier Clause,\" some four to six parties will \\ndisappear after failing to get five percent of the vote.  But many \\nof the members of these dying parties will join the government \\ncoalition, as will the PMDB, which will again elect around 80 \\ndeputies. \\n \\n------------------- \\nTHE NEED FOR REFORM \\n------------------- \\n \\n7.  (SBU) For the duration of the campaign, Netto predicted, neither \\nLula nor Alckmin will make much in the way of concrete proposals on \\nwhat programs they would undertake.  Doing so would gain them no \\nvoters and would likely cost them some.  Rather, they will campaign \\non generalities and platitudes, and will also expend some energy \\ntrying to \"deconstruct\" one another.  But whoever is in office in \\nJanuary will face certain hard realities, Netto pointed out.  A \\nSocial Security reform is urgently needed; without it, he said, \\nBrazil will soon face a fiscal crisis.  Labor reform is also \\ncritical.  However, Netto believed it would be difficult for a \\nPresident Alckmin to push such reforms through Congress, since the \\nPT and other leftist parties would vociferously oppose them. \\nHowever, if President Lula, coming off re-election, were to put them \\nforward, he could likely win leftist support (or, if not support, \\nacquiescence) for the measures, and even the opposition PSDB and \\nLiberal Front Party (PFL) would have to vote for some of the reforms \\non their merits.  For this reason, Netto said he himself will vote \\nfor Lula, because he believes Lula is in a better position to have a \\nsuccessful government. \\n \\n------- \\nCOMMENT \\n------- \\n \\n8.  (SBU) Netto\\'s stated reason for preferring Lula over Alckmin is \\nnovel and interesting (and likely self-serving), but begs the \\nquestion of whether a re-elected President Lula would in fact decide \\nto take on social security and labor reform, and other much-needed \\ninitiatives.  For many observers, Lula\\'s first term has lacked focus \\nand vision, which does not augur well for a serious reform agenda in \\nthe second term, since such an agenda would require Lula\\'s direct \\nand sustained attention and involvement in order to get it through \\n \\nSAO PAULO 00000907  003 OF 003 \\n \\n \\nan inherently fractious Congress.

Jarbas retold a bit of the overthrow of Joao \\nGoulart by the Brazilian military in 1964, noting that Goulart had \\nsown the seeds of his government\\'s demise by undermining two pillars \\nthat were fundamental to military support: discipline and hierarchy. \\n But Jarbas said the end was provoked by two editorials in leading \\ndaily \"O Estado de Sao Paulo.\" By comparison, he noted, Lula has \\nsurvived a relentless and ongoing media attack and is heading for \\nre-election.  Jarbas did not say how Lula might be forced out before \\nthe end of his second term, but he seemed to be suggesting it would \\nbe a resignation in the face of overwhelming opposition. \\n \\n3.  (SBU) Jarbas said he believed that Lula will win re-election in \\nthe first round, but foresaw a very poor relationship with congress. \\n He predicted the PMDB, the PFL (Party of the Liberal Front) and \\nPSDB (Party of Brazilian Social Democracy) would each have 17 \\nsenators, or 51 out of 81 senate seats. He said Lula would not be \\nable to get along with such a congress.  Part of the PMDB supports \\nthe Lula government, while another faction remains in opposition; \\nJarbas did not say how many of the PMDB senators would be \\npro-government and how many opposition.  Jarbas also said the PSOL \\n(Party of Solidarity and Liberty), the far left party of Heloisa \\nHelena, the presidential candidate polling third at about ten \\npercent, would decline after the election. \\n \\n4.  (SBU) Many voters do not care enough about the corruption \\nscandals of Lula4s first term, Jarbas said, and they will vote for \\nLula.  Many of Lula4s supporters, especially those with little \\neducation, will vote loyally for the PT by choosing candidates on \\nthe ballot whose numbers start with 13, the PT\\'s number, he \\nexplained.  Because of this loyalty to the PT among the poor, Jarbas \\nsaid the PT block in Congress, currently just over 90 federal \\ndeputies and senators, will not be reduced by more than 10 or 15 \\nseats.  Jarbas also said Lula was running a good campaign, while \\nAlckmin\\'s campaign was weak.  The only one affected locally by \\ncorruption charges, in Jarbas\\' view, is Severino Cavalcanti, a \\nPernambuco politician who was forced to resign from the presidency \\nof the Chamber of Deputies for taking bribes from the congressional \\ncafeteria concession.  Jarbas expected an electoral defeat for him. \\n \\n \\n5.  (SBU) While most of the PMDB remains in Lula\\'s camp, Jarbas does \\nnot moderate his anti-Lula stance.  He was not always an \\nanti-Lulista: he said he recommended the PMDB cooperate with Lula in \\n2003 when Lula first took office, but the PMDB refused.  Jarbas, who \\nis as critical of his own party as he is of the Lula government, \\nsaid that refusal was strong evidence that the PMDB acted out of \\nself-interest regardless of what was good for Brazil.  Jarbas said \\nthe majority of the PMDB was \"rotten,\" and an ideological grab-bag \\n(\"a sack of cats\").  Still, he said he has not joined another party \\nbecause he does not have a PSDB \"profile,\" and he does not feel \\nclose enough to any other party to switch.  (Jarbas was elected \\ngovernor of Pernambuco in 1998 and re-elected in 2002 in the same \\n \\nBRASILIA 00001961  002 OF 002 \\n \\n \\nelection that brought Lula to power.  He resigned recently to run \\nfor the Senate.) \\n \\n6.  (SBU) Jarbas added that in 2003 he became aware of extensive \\ncorruption at a national level and warned his state government \\nadministrators to be on guard against it in Pernambuco.  Lula was \\nfully aware of all the corruption scandals, Jarbas was certain, \\nbecause there was rampant cronyism. \\n \\n7.  (U) Jarbas was confident of his own election to the senate and \\nsaid his polling shows he is at 66 percent with Pernambuco voters. \\n \\n8.  (SBU) Comment:  Some of Jarbas\\' observations struck us as \\nreasonable, except for the stunning and rather mysterious prediction \\nthat Lula might not finish his second term.  Coming from such a \\nlevel-headed and well-respected politician, Jarbas\\'s forecast of \\nstormy political weather ahead is a warning that political gridlock \\ncould revisit Brazil in one form or another in a second Lula \\npresidency. \\n \\n9.  (SBU) Comment continued.  Given Jarbas\\' long-time role in \\nNortheast politics and his good relations with Lula when he was \\ngovernor, his frank and negative comments came as a surprise.  He \\ntakes the role of the realist in politics, but he made very clear \\nthat he did not condone corrupt practices in any party.  He will \\nhave an interesting role to play in the Senate, and he believes that \\nhis vice governor, Jose Mendonca Filho, will take the election in \\nPernambuco and be his surrogate there. \\n \\nSOBEL \\n',\n",

       "      u'summary': u'The re-election of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be a \"tragedy\" and his government will perform so badly he may not finish his term of office, according to Pernambuco\\'s former Governor Jarbas Vasconcelos, (strictly protect), a veteran PMDB (Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement) politician from Pernambuco state and candidate for Senate. Jarbas did not specify how Lula4s second term might end prematurely, but he described a discouraging political landscape during a meeting with visiting Embassy poloff and Recife Principal Officer on September 5. Jarbas said he had no doubt that Lula knew of all the corruption scandals that erupted during his first term, but most voters do not care enough about corruption to reject Lula at the ballot box, in spite of relentless media attacks on him. He dismissed predictions of a deep reduction in the PT (Workers Party) seats in Congress, but said Lula will have a hard time working with the new Congress, which will be against him. Most of Jarbas\\'s own party, the PMDB, is \"rotten,\" he said, but he explained that he did not feel he had a place in another party. Polling shows Jarbas should easily win the senate seat being vacated by Jose Jorge, opposition presidential candidate Geraldo Alckmin\\'s running mate.

BRASILIA 1819 \\n     B. BRASILIA 1849 \\n     C. BRASILIA 1867 \\n \\n1.(SBU) SUMMARY.  A Sensus survey published in Brazil on July \\n12 reported a 2.5% increase in President Lula\\'s approval \\nrating since May.  While ongoing investigations of scandals \\nhave greatly tarnished his PT party\\'s image over the past few \\nweeks, Lula thus far has been successful in disassociating \\nhimself from the corruption allegations and remains the \\nfront-runner in the 2006 presidential elections.  END \\nSUMMARY. \\n \\nFAITH IN THE PRESIDENT, NOT THE PARTY \\n------------------------------------- \\n \\n2.(U) The July 12 CNT-Sensus survey indicates that President \\nLula\\'s approval rating rose from 57% in May to 60% in July. \\nThe survey was conducted between July 5-7, following the \\nseries of corruption revelations that started on May 22, but \\nbefore some of the more recent revelations involving Lula\\'s \\nWorkers\\' Party (PT) (reftels).  When asked who was more \\ninvolved in the corruption scandals, the voters replied: \\nCongress (35%); the PT (31%); and Lula (12%).  Almost half of \\nthose surveyed--46%--felt Lula was unaware of the vote-buying \\nscheme, while 34% felt he knew about it.  The Sensus results \\ncoincided with the Ipsos-Opinion survey taken June 21-29 and \\npublished in the weekly Veja magazine.  According to this \\nsurvey, 45% said that \"Lula knew nothing about the corruption \\nscandal\"; 39% said he \"knew something but did nothing to \\ncorrect the situation\"; and only 16% thought that Lula \"knew \\nabout the scandal and was involved.\"  The Ipsos-Opinion \\nsurvey also found that 55% believed Lula to be an honest \\npolitician, while only 36% deemed the PT to be honest. \\nAccording to Sensus poll projections for the October 2006 \\nelections, Lula would defeat Jose Serra, PSDB mayor of Sao \\nPaulo and Lula\\'s opponent in 2002, by a margin of nearly 14 \\npoints. \\n \\nCOMMENT: \\n-------- \\n \\n3.(SBU) Despite the corruption scandal, Lula is riding out \\nthe storm, averaging approval ratings comparable to when he \\nfirst came into office.  These surveys indicate that his \\npersonal image has not yet been irreparably tarnished by the \\ncorruption scandal.  If he is successful in cleaning house \\nwith his ongoing cabinet shuffle (reftel 1867) and keeps the \\neconomy on track, his candidacy for the October 2006 election \\nshould remain viable.  This is assuming, though, that no new \\nrevelations emerge tying Lula more directly to the \\nimpropriety, and that continuous media coverage of the crisis \\ndoes not change voters\\' perception of their president\\'s \\ncredibility. \\nCHICOLA \\n',\n",

(U) SUMMARY:  On March 14, 2009 President Obama met with \\nPresident Lula of Brazil in Washington, D.C. at the White House and \\nthe meeting was covered extensively by the Brazilian media.  The \\nfollowing media reaction cable summarizes some of the Sao Paulo \\nbased Brazilian media reports published on Sunday, March 15.  The \\nsummaries focus on the economy, G-20, Sean Goldman case, the \\npersonal relationship between the two presidents and MFA-former \\nAmbassador comments. END SUMMARY \\n \\nObama and Lula Discuss Economy, Biofuels and G-20 \\n--------------- \\n2.  (U)  Main articles in Estado and Folha emphasize the agenda \\ndiscussed by Presidents Obama and Lula during their 2-hour meeting \\non Saturday- March 14.  According to reports, the presidents have \\nasked their high-level officials to develop a joint strategy to \\ncombat the global economic crisis in the upcoming weeks.  The \\nproposal is to be presented by the two leaders at the G-20 meeting \\nin April.  \"Obama\\'s proposal to form a Brazil-U.S. group in order to \\nwork jointly in the G-20 was extremely important,\" said President \\nLula in a press conference.  Folha highlights that President Obama \\ninvited Chief Economic Adviser Larry Summers to participate in the \\nmeeting.  Folha also noted that Obama defended the goal of a global, \\ncoordinated action in order to counter the current world recession. \\nLula once more declared that the U.S. is largely responsible for the \\nfinancial crisis and offered that [the U.S.] nationalizing banks is \\npart of the solution. \\n \\nFolha states that \"the alliance established between the world\\'s \\nrichest nation and Latin America\\'s largest economy around the \\neconomic crisis marks a new stage in the bilateral relations.\" \\nEstado and Folha say that Obama and Lula seemed at ease and in a \\ngood mood, exchanging jokes throughout the joint press availability. \\n But there were also disagreements when the issue of ethanol came \\nup.  Obama acknowledged that biofuels have been \"a source of tension \\nbetween the two countries.\"  Lula said he could not understand why a \\nclean fuel such as ethanol is heavily taxed, but added: \"I never \\nexpect an immediate answer. It is a process.\"  Obama agreed that the \\nissue is \"not going to change overnight.\"  According to Valor \\nEcontmico, Lula stated that associating ethanol in efforts to fight \\nglobal warming has become the most auspicious area to deepen \\nU.S.-Brazil relations. \\n \\nAccording to reports, Obama and Lula committed to fighting \\nprotectionism and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Foreign \\nMinister Celso Amorim will meet to discuss ways to do so. But the \\npresidents were pessimistic about advances in global trade.  \"Our \\ngoal is to at least not go backwards. It may be difficult for us to \\nfinalize a whole host of trade deals in the midst of an economic \\ncrisis like this one,\" Obama said. \\n \\nSources: Folha de S.Paulo A4: \"Obama and Lula discuss action to \\ncombat crisis and trade tension\"; O Estado de S.Paulo A4: \"Lula \\nmeets Obama and announces joint action for G-20 summit\"; O Estado de \\nS.Paulo A8: \"U.S. president warns that barriers to ethanol will not \\nbe lifted now\"; Valor Economico A3 (Monday edition): \"Lula-Obama \\nmeeting diminishes chances for Doha\" \\n \\nSean Goldman Case \\n--------------- \\n3.  (U)  Side stories say that during a press conference, President \\nLula confirmed that President Obama raised the topic of the Sean \\nGoldman case.  \"Obama thanked the Brazilian government\\'s actions \\nthat led to the case being heard by a Brazilian federal court.  We \\nhope that the judiciary does what it has to do; I am not a lawyer \\nand I cannot give an opinion.  Whatever decision is reached, the \\nBrazilian government will comply with it,\" stated Lula.  Folha also \\nmentions that while President Obama and President Lula met, a group \\nof supporters of David Goldman held a demonstration outside the \\nWhite House. \\n \\nSources: O Estado de S.Paulo A4: \"American mentions Sean case\"; \\nFolha de S.Paulo A14: \"Obama thanks Brazil for taking dispute over \\nboy to federal court\" \\n \\nObama- You must be talking to my wife \\n--------------- \\n4.  (U)  The two Folha articles state that the meeting between \\nPresident Obama and President Lula was surrounded by the same \\nexpectation from both sides: that it would mark the beginning of a \\ncordial and close relationship between the two leaders.  Stories \\nhighlight that President Lula was the third head of state to meet \\nPresident Obama at the White House.  Diplomats from both countries \\nsay the choice of meeting with Lula shows that Brazil is stable \\npolitically and economically; that it an undisputed leader in Latin \\nAmerica and also an emerging country in the global arena.  During \\nthe joint press avail, in what has been labeled a gaffe by the \\npress, Lula told reporters he did not want to be holding the \"hot \\npotato\" the U.S. president has in his hands, prompting Obama to \\nlaugh and tell Lula that  \"it sounds  like you\\'ve been talking to my \\nwife.\"  By-liners remembered that in 2007 President Lula caused then \\nPresident Bush to laugh when he stated that Brazil and the U.S. had \\nreached the \"G-spot\" of the bilateral relations. \\n \\nReports also quote President Obama saying he is looking forward to \\nvisiting Brazil and that he is aware he has many \"friends\" in the \\ncountry.  Asked about a date for the visit, Obama said nothing has \\nbeen decided yet, but as far as destinations go, he would like to \\nsee the \"beautiful beaches\" in Rio and perhaps do to the Amazon, \\njoking that Republicans probably would like to see him get lost \\nthere for a while. \\n \\nSources: Folha de S. Paulo A8: \"In the bilateral relations, out with \\nthe \\'G-spot\\' and in with the \\'hot potato\\'\"; Folha de S. Paulo A8: \\n\"Meeting allows presidents to become close\"; O Estado de S.Paulo: \\n\"You must be talking to my wife,\" jokes host. \\n \\nComments from MFA and former Brazilian Ambassadors \\n--------------- \\n5.  (U)  Estado story states that last week when trying to summarize \\nthe U.S.-Brazil bilateral relations, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim \\nacknowledged that the agenda has shown small progress, aside from \\nthe cooperation in the energy sector.  Paper says that the stall in \\nrelations dates to the Clinton-Cardoso era.  Estado points out that \\nsince Lula first met Bush in 2003 promising a successful conclusion \\nto the FTAA, the trade accord fell through the cracks, the Doha \\nRound \\'shows no vital signs\\' and Brazil had no other path to \\nnegotiate opening of the U.S. market.  Brazil\\'s claim for support \\ntowards a seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council has \\nalso gone unanswered, says story citing that when asked about it in \\n2006, A/S Thomas Shannon \"choked, took a step back, laughed and did \\nnot respond.\"  At the same time, Estado affirms that in 2005 the \\nWhite House unsuccessfully tried to engage Brazil in a partnership \\nto stop democracy from eroding in Latin America.  By refusing to \\nintervene, Brazil received the White House\\'s blessings to deal with \\nregional leaders, thus consolidating its hegemony in South America. \\n \\nTwo former Brazilian ambassadors to the U.S. --Roberto Abdenur and \\nRubens Barbosa-commented on the meeting between Presidents Obama and \\nLula.  Roberto Abdenur expressed optimism and said even if the two \\ndo not enjoy the same \"impressive chemistry\" displayed by Lula and \\nBush; the link between the two countries is determined more by \\nconcrete facts than by personal ties.  Abdenur also believes that \\nsince Brazil overcame the issue of the external debt, the U.S. \\nstarted regarding the country as a leader with the potential to \\nbecome a partner, thus becoming \"part of the solution.\"  Meanwhile, \\nRubens Barbosa states that he believes the meeting will not solve \\nthe pending issues between the two countries, but it positions \\nBrazil as a \"privileged interlocutor\" of the U.S. administration. \\n \\nSources:  O Estado de S.Paulo A8: \"Bilateral agenda suffers from \\nimmobility\"; Folha de S. Paulo A14: \"Former ambassador says meeting \\nhas a \\'symbolic value\\'\"; O Estado de S.Paulo A9: \"\\'Brazil is part of \\nthe solution for the U.S\\'\" \\nWHITE \\n',\n",
